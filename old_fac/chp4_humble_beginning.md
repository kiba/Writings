# Chapter Four: Humble Beginning

***
**Entry One**

It's different from playing the game for sure, because I am not staring overhead at a map. To fix that, I build a drone out of spare parts out of the nanofab so that I can have a overhead vision of my environment.

Now it's just like factorio, sort of.

Unlike the game where I have to unlock technology in weird lab modules, I can just browse it through the list of tech I can build. Unfortunately, I am limited by 'vitamins' rather than research, because I simply don't have enough materials. So I have to choose wisely.

Next to the drone, I chose to build a turret first before doing anything else, which was uncomplicated for the nanofab.

Unfortunately, it took an hour to build.

**Entry Two**

Andy: Hey, when we are going to land?

Engineer: Whenever I get enough fuels to get up there and fuel you.

Andy: How long is that?

Engineer: I don't know.

Andy: What are we supposed to do up there?

Engineer: Don't touch anything you don't know about. If you want to be useful, go through the auto-tutor and learn how to take care of the ship.

Andy: I thought we are paying for you to fix our ship?

Engineer: You paid the company to take you there. I was supposed to help setup the mining facility and then leave. But somebody somehow fucked up the coordinates intentionally.

Andy: Hehe...

Engineer: Anyway, the company's a cheap bastard. They set up the bare minimum needed for survival to beef up their margin, dropped training standard for customers, and now we're fucked.

Andy: What!!?

Engineer: What are you expecting when you get no training whatsoever, and everything is easy peasy when you get support through the intra-dimensional network? Now I have to dig ourselves out of this mess, and we don't know where the fuck we are on the dimensional map. We'll probably never get back. I shouldn't had taken this job.

Andy: YOU'RE LYING TO ME! I PAID GOOD MONEY FOR THAT KIT.

Engineer: Stop yelling at the only competent person trying to save your ass.

Andy: !@##$R scammer! I want my fucking money back!

**Entry Three**

Andy started a temper tantrum after hearing my assessment on the corporation that he hired. Suffice to say, I shut him off, hope that he doesn't blow up the ship, and get back to work.

It was Andy's fault that got us here, but moreover it was the company's fault for such lax training and poor selection of customers, and insufficient provision.

Factory-wise, I had already set up infrastructure and made my first modification. I scrapped the burner miner drills and modify it into a mini-electric drill.

I found ore deposits and I am already starting to refine those materials into usable metal.

Then I fabbed a drone to scout the rest of the environment.

Another limitation I discovered: my power armor do not have any fabbing capability.

**Entry Four**

Biters found. Help!

***
**Entry Five**

My first biter kill, ripped apart from conveniently placed turret.

***
**Entry Six**

I found a blueprint for manufacturing graphene chips. Excellent.

***
**Entry Seven**

Betty: I am sorry for my husband's outburst and I am sorry that my husband stranded us here forever.

Engineer: It can't be undone. All I want to know is if your husband is a liability or not. Is he?

Betty: I can't promise that...

Engineer: If he can't control himself, then we won't have a cadet branch of humanity here. Look, your family is very necessary to the colony's success, as well as all the support equipment needed to keep a healthy production line. If your equipment so much as malfunctioned and you can't fix it? Well, we are in deep trouble until I can reproduce it, and it's an uncertain bet.

Betty: Why?

Engineer: Because there are hostile natives down here. Big scary monsters that come out of a horror movie. Don't believe me? See this [video].

Betty: That's.....I don't even know what to say. What if my husband is a liability.

Engineer: If he is a more of a liability than an asset, kill him, hibernate him, whatever.

Betty: What? I can't do that! That's horrible. No, I'll never do it.

Engineer: I can't claim that this is moral, but we all have to make horrible choices when confronted with a hostile reality. Good day.

**Entry Eight**

It was a good thing that I already set up walls, because the biters are already attacking. If this were the moon, the pollutants wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, we're on a garden planet, which was not the exactly the kind of location that the mining toolkit was designed for.

Their loud screech and shrill really hurt my ears, so I filtered it out.

***
**Entry Nine**

I finally set up a research lab. It's actually a supercomputer with a VI designed for research. Eventually, it will grow into a powerful AI.

You don't actually feed arbitrary items into the lab, but you do need to build a research complex to do research.

***
**Entry Nine**

I built a biology lab to do research. Alien corpses are getting dissected and analyzed. Yay!

***
**Entry Ten**

Fuck! There's giant flying biters. They're getting over my walls, sometime transporting a land biter. Then they wreck havoc with my infrastructure.

***
**Entry Eleven**

I started building drones. They're slow as hell and required a lot of electricity. Now my base can auto-repair.

***
**Entry Twelves**

Andy: TALK TO ME GOD DAMN IT!

Engineer: You pinged me fifty-five times. For fuck's sake, calm down.

Andy: CALM DOWN??!!! You told my wife to kill me.

Engineer: If you are a liability. Are you a liability?

Andy: I AM NOT A LIABILITY! YOU ARE!

Engineer: Because?

Andy: Because. you. told. my. wife. to. kill. me.

Engineer: No, I told her if she deemed it necessary, she will kill you. I didn't expect her to babble the words to you.

Andy: We don't keep secrets.

Engineer: That's nice. A question: are you going to kill me if I come up in orbit and try to rescue the colony ship?

Andy: No.

Engineer: Alright then. I'll risk my life.
