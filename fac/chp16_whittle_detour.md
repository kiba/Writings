# Chapter Sixteen: Whittle's Detour

Frank Whittle looked upward at the shattered moon from the roof of his home, a reminder that he wasn't on Earth anymore. Cool breeze of air continuously flowed over his body on the recliner. He thought about the latest test. Engine revision 112 exploded right at the end of a workday. Instead of working out the root cause, his workmates decided to go home. However, Frank Whittle couldn't stop thinking about work, even when he was supposed to be relaxing.

Soft footsteps reached Whittle's ears.

"Frank? Thinking about work again?" A deep feminine voice asked.

"Yeah," he said. His eyes can barely spot the dark outline of his oh-so-beautiful wife, with her soft brown eyes, clear complexion, red and black hairs, and probably wearing a hardsuit. The last part made him feel better. As an Earthling, he always worried about the lack of armor that her wife wore. She wore whatever she liked, damned the consequence. Now that she was working for Mechatron Special Operation, she always wore more practical uniforms and suits.

She sat down right next to his body, before falling on his chest. She wasn't in her armor like he thought, and now her soft skins pressed against him. For once, he was grateful for that. The wife put her hand on Whittle's face, feeling up Whittle's rough beard. He neglected to shave for the past few days.

The rocket scientist didn't put much stock into keeping up his appearances. Despite this, in a single year, he married the huntress who rescued him. Maybe it was the beard that she loved to keep stroking?

"You should be thinking of me, instead of your rocket," she said.

"Flae, you should know what's happening when I think about you."

"Think positive thoughts, like all the dates we have together. Didn't your therapist said that?"

Whittle sighed. "I don't have time for this."

"Of course you do. Without downtime, you'll break down."

She stood up, her arms dragging her husband up by his hand.

"Come to bed. At the very least, I'll distract you from your troubles."

When work resumed in the morning, he was happy that he was making forward progress, but his team was in a race against time. Their rocket was far more ambitious than the other two rocket projects funded by SETO. The design was a complete jump into dust-based rocketry, rather than sticking to conventional rocket fuels such as hydrogen or kerosene. However, replicating the ancients' rocket technology was far more difficult than anticipated, which in turned might end up getting his rocket canned by the kingdoms for being too difficult.

There aren't many days left. On Earth, that would justify overnight crunch mode.

His workmates told him that he was too paranoid, that they wouldn't pull the plug when a year didn't even pass. It was just a review of the team's progress. Maybe they're right. They do know the world more than him after living in it for a while. But he has had bad experience with crappy funding and short deadlines on Remnant. So he wasn't exactly trusting of the committee. If only Furukawa and Gearworth made the real decisions rather than simply chairing them.

His team closed up at the end of the day at five PM sharp, rather than work overtime to make up for lost time, five PM sharp. If he didn't get out, he would be heckled by the guard to go home.

He might have tried to raise his opinion on working overtime once more, or stubbornly continued to work from home, much to the dismay of his wife. Today was different. He was just too drained.

The engineer decided not to even walk. using the moving sidewalk ubiquitous to Mechatron to transport him at a leisurely pace.

Whittle spotted his student, Blue Horowitz, at an open air cafe. Piqued, he walked off the moving sidewalk into the cafe.

When he came closer, he noticed a teenager, part of a squad that Flae was particularly fond of inviting to her house, as well as a blonde off-duty soldier.

They're all playing a game that resembled very much like Starcraft. He wasn't sure where he got the idea from, but Whittle wasn't much of a gamer. He preferred to focus on important projects where he can make a big impact on humanity.

The young teenager, whose name is Satoshi, made a predatory smile as he watched the other two ganged up on him.

With a fury of rapid movement, Satoshi brushed away his adversaries in a matter of minutes, sending the blonde soldier and Blue into the pit of despair. With victory in his hand, Satoshi laughed.

"No fair! That's...just not possible," Jaune Arc's voice said. That triggered the rocket scientist's memory of Satoshi's dexterity feats at a small talent show organized for family and friends. He knew exactly why Satoshi won.

This game, ostentatiously a "real time strategy" game, was more like a button smashing game. Micromanaging a unit's movement matters far too much for a game that should be about strategy, but it played to Satoshi's advantage.

"What's sup, old man?" Blue rudely greeted the rocket scientist. The eighteen years old had already gotten over his defeat.

"Brat, I told you to stop calling me that," Whittle replied, annoyed.

"Only if you stop calling me brat."

He decided to change the subject. "I thought you're supposed to be studying engineering?"

"Hey! Just because I have fun right now doesn't mean I am slacking off. Wait, why are you here?"

"I am curious as to what are you doing inside the cafe. That is all. One more thing, you shouldn't play against him in any games that involved high dexterity skill. That's his strength."

"I noticed. Truth be told, we tried a more tactical game, and we still got our asses handed over. Even with Jaune Arc, and he's from the military, Satoshi still crush us. Seriously, he pulled out tactical moves from nowhere."

"A quality that I must have missed, because he never shown that in the times he been invited by my wife to my house."

Blue blinked. "You know him?"

"Of course. I know everything interesting." Blue frown at the non-answer.

"OH!" Blue exclaimed. "I forgot something. I need to show you a project that I am working on."

"Here, right now? Or at the university?"

"Here. It's not a secret project or anything. I just want your opinion on it."

Whittle nodded. He can't seem to leave his student alone even when this teenager drove him up the wall.
