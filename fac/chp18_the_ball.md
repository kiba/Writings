# Chapter Eighteen: The Ball

General James Ironwood and his partner arrived in the ballroom.

There's an extreme uniformity and bare utilitarianism present through Mechatron engineering, suggesting that Mechatron as a kingdom lacking creativity, at least when it comes to government buildings. The first embassies in Mechatron were a series of warehouse, and all the furniture in that embassy were evident copies of one another. "Any color so long as it's black or grey" was joked as its unofficial motto.

Any misunderstanding of the kingdom as against the ideology of freedom and art was quickly rectified by its citizenry, through decoration and other means, such as large scale murals, graffiti, and mosaics.

"This is different," Glynda Goodwitch observed.

"For the wedding, they decided that the pipes and boring concrete wall will not do," Ironwood elaborated on what Goodwitch was seeing.

If Ironwood didn't know better, he would have thought that this place was extremely opulent. The ceiling was very high and open, reminiscent of a church, with pillars 'supporting' the ceilings, and the walls was decorated with scenery composed of a mosaics of gems from before the fall. The highest cost was probably the labor in designing all of this, rather than putting it altogether. He knew that much from the intelligence report on Mechatron's industrial capacity. One of their larger exports was their gems.

"Oh! So you did show up!" a familiar voice beckoned for his attention. "General James Ironwood and Miss Glynda Goodwitch, I am pleased to see you." The voice came from a young woman in her late twentieis, with green hair and brown eyes. They both recognized her as the Queen of the Kingdom of Mantle, annexed to Atlas in the last great war.

"Just in time to watch the royal wedding," Ironwood replied. He tried hard not to twitch in front of his queen, the woman who was always a thorn in the side of the Atlasian council and the military.

"I got a table reserved just for us," the queen said, while leading the general and a huntress to a table. "You should have been there. The food, the entertainment, the people, they're all fantastic!"

"I got work," Ironwood said.

"Of course you do!"

"Aren't they already married?" Goodwitch asked.

"Special circumstances! They faked being a kingdom and co-rulers before they were ever a kingdom. Not that their love was ever in question, or so they told me."

"I am well aware of their circumstances. The only reason we have taken them seriously at all was the appearance of a kingdom's worth of military power."

Soft piano music played as the royal couple came into the center of the room. Everyone else retreated as they let the empress and emperor of Mechatron danced.

"I would had never guessed that one of them would be my ancestor," Goodwitch said. "Though I find it hard to believe that her husband is from another world."

"Speaking of different worlds, there's a legend about a sanctuary," the queen said. " A safe but primitive world. I thought Earth might be that world described in the legend. I talked to one of their Earth society member, a flunky from Beacon Academy."

"That's a rude way to speak of a former student of mine," Goodwitch admonished. "His name is Blue Horowitz. Despite the falsified transcript, we saw nothing to suspect on his time with the academy, not with hisacademic record, leadership, or his fighting ability."

The queen ignored that remark. "He said his world isn't primitive at all, and that it would be a mistake to think of his world as a sanctuary, despite the lack of Grimm and the domination of mankind."

"Then what is it? What make their world so dangerous?" Ironwood wondered.

"You know the history before the fall?"

"I read quite a bit," Goodwitch admitted.

"I got the gist of it," Ironwood said.

"It's basically like that. One of their best weapons was powerful bombs launched by rockets. One rocket can wreck several cities at once with several warheads. If it weren't for those threats, his people would fight total war against each other."

Ironwood's face contorted with unease. "It is precisely the destructive capability that made me worried about this kingdom. They launched rockets, delivering satellites in orbit, which in turn made the CCTS redundant overnight."

"Redundancy is a good thing," the queen interjected.

"That's not the point, but they could just as easily develop a powerful bomb to deliver that to a kingdom."

"They never acted so hostile to us," the queen of Mantle said. "And their level of cooperation with the kingdoms gave us insight into their magnificent industrial capability. Or do you suggest that we should plifer the kingdom for all their secrets without giving anything back?"

"Are you in league with Mechatron? I thought you were for Atlas?"

"Mantle, James. It's always the kingdom of Mantle, not Atlas. If the Atlasian government doesn't support my kingdom's interest, I will, even if that means I have to twist Atlas' arm to form an alliance with Mechatron."

"You have no power."

The queen of Mantle glared at Ironwood.

The applause came through, melting the tension around the table. The dance has finished, and new music started up, this time, with the sound of jazz. Crowd of people started dancing again.

"What do you have against Mechatron?" the queen questioned.

"I don't have anything against the colonists of this kingdom," Ironwood declared. "They are our blood, and we should support their effort in this frontier. They should have this land as far as they could push back against the Grimm. But...that man the empress is marrying is volatile. He gets angry when we do things that he doesn't like, or if he doesn't get his way. His wife is the only person who could calm him down and reach a compromise with us."

"I don't know. I liked him for his uncompromising no-nonsense push to make everything better. I think I want to marry him."

"It seemed that his wife has more political sense than the emperor," Goodwitch opined. "And with the prime minister in charge, both his wife and his political influence is vastly reduced."

"That can only be a good thing," Ironwood concurred. "The more that man stay away from the politic, the better it is for the world."
