# Chapter Twenty: Survival

Sergeant Jaune Arc once tried to cheat his way into Beacon Academy so that he can become a huntsman, but he never thought much about what it would actually entrails. He wanted to save people, to be someone who matters. Of course, the sergeant knew better what to expect now. A huntsman frequently ended up missing, never coming back to his or her loved ones.

Instead of dying at the initiation ritual, Arc lived two more years into the future, became a real soldier, and got promoted up through the rank as the military expanded. He now patrolled with his squad and a couple of huntsmen-in-training from Beacon Academy. He was grateful for the force addition. They might take all the glory, but they reduce the risk of everyone dying as well.

Today was a simple search and destroy mission deep inside an old growth forest, a measure to temporarily reduce the population of Grimm until new fortifications can be fully established. Then, the economy here will be able to support a population and churn out its own machines, establishing a stronger claim on this land, pushing away the force of darkness.

"Hey! Team JNPR! Don't wonder too far away from the protective parameter!" Arc warned over the radio.

"We'll be fine!" Nora radioed back. "We're huntsmen."

"Don't knock them," an older man said, "They'll need a few seasoning before they realized that they are not invincible."

The sergeant sighed. Didn't they go to secondary combat school before attending universities? They might be students but they should have a depth of experience that tells them to be less reckless. Then again, charging into the face of soulless monsters is pretty reckless.

The soldiers of mechatron are certainly different from the huntsmen in many ways. They are taught never to engage their opponents in melee until they are very close. Their attitude is of cautiousness rather than bravo.

Arc sighed in resignation. "At least they're doing all the work."

Monster screams and the sound of gunfire echoed throughout the forests, none of which were caused by the squad, but rather by the huntsmen attached to them. Mostly, the squad of eight soldiers walked at a slow pace, surrounded by a protective coon of Mechatron robots, which outnumbered humans ten to one. The soldiers were more concerned about making back home alive rather than killing scores of Grimm.

The blonde thought back to his auburn colored girlfriend who he first met after finishing bootcamp.

It was....

The burp of machine gun fire interrupted his thought.

"Contact!" another teammate said.

All the sudden, the robots were firing westward.

Arc engaged the enemies with his rifle as well, spewing bullets at holographic waypoints. His armor readily steadied his aims, but most of his bullets hit nothing.

"Team JNPR?! Need help here!" Arc shouted. "Damn it! We need to get out of there! Where the hell are they coming from?" Artillery unavailable. Units rapidly dwindling. Enemy counter increasing. Every indicator on his HUD was just more bad news.

All a sudden, a ursa got sliced in half by a sword.

"Jarl! You're alive!" Arc exclaimed in relief.

He could see markers nearby converging on Jarl, the leader of team JNPR. Everyone else was still alive too.

"We need to get out of here," the huntsman-in-training stated.

"Damn right. Except all support options are unavailable. Our enemies are multiplying."

"Then we'll have to cut through the grimm."

"Alright men, you heard the guy. Time to go melee," Arc ordered.

The armored men drop masses of protective slabs to the ground, sacrificing protection for flexibility and agility, and relying more on their shield to protect them from harm. Battle axes and warhammers were withdrawn. Lastly, they have aura for further augmentation and protection.

"Let's go," Arc said.

They jaunted east, with robots providing covering fire against the West, but it became quickly clear that the protective coon of armor was fast shredding away.

The monsters were relentless, simply bulldozing their way through hailstorm of bullets by sheer number.

As for Arc's squad, they sliced through stray Grimm, while picking up more robots to delay the enemy.

Finally, they jumped over a wall of soldiers and turrets.

"Keep running! Keep running!" the commander of the outpost shouted. "This place is about to blow!"

The burp of automated gunfire rose even as they ran with the soldiers manning the post. Arc did a quick visual check that they aren't leaving anyone behind.

Nobody talked. They kept running westward, toward the safety of the bastion.

Ten kilometers away, the outpost shifted into an enormous mushroom cloud, throwing up rocks and dirts. Scores of Grimm die.

The Grimm kept moving.

***

The thump sounds coming from artillery fire, oddly enough, was a comforting sound.

Thump, thump, thump, all in continuous, rapid succession.

In the distance, there were booms, catering the landscrape and exploding Grimm by the dozen.

As long as that hold, this bastion should be safe.

The team rested at one of the tower above a wall of turrets.

Arc paged through his holographic pad, looking at the battle map. It still didn't look good, even with the fuel bombs and artillery shelling.

The enemy's number wasn't decreasing.

"What's going on Jaune?" the redhead asked innocently. Arc was not dense. He could see the glint in her eyes, her desire for him. He chose to ignore it. After all he already has a girlfriend.

"Well...fifty-one of ours didn't make it fast enough...."

"I am sorry," she said.

"I haven't felt a personal loss yet, so....I am more worried about the battle. We aren't winning but we aren't losing either. We're expending artillery shells as fast as we can, but at this rate, we'll be out in a matter of hours, even with resupply."

"What happens after that?" Jarl inquired.

"Then they'll get to our wall. The turrets keep firing until they either run out or is destroyed. The turrets are mostly gatling guns, so their firepower is really great, but they'll run through ammo really fast. If the grimms are smart, they'll target the train routes rather than the bastions. So we'll have to retreat to the last bastion before that happens."

"All personnels are to disembark for the train," the PA system announced. "This is not a drill. All personnels..."

Everyone looked at each other in alarm. Even Nora wasn't sunny at all.

"This battle is lost," Jarl concluded.
