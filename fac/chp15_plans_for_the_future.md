# Chapter Fifteen: Plans for the Future

**Year 2: Day 201**

There's a very interesting mural right in the cave where the stargate was housed.

Some guy who looked like a monk(Six path sage?) used really large animals and magic to whoop some snake parasite bastard asses and expelled them.

I could be misinterpreting it, but I think it's a story about the expulsion of the Goa'uld by kung-fu wizards.

**Year 2: Day 203**

Things went fuck up in the medical bay of the new Mechatron Stargate Command. A soldier tried to unlock the redhead ninja's aura, only to have it backfired.

We were almost forced to put her in stasis.

**Year 2: Day 204**

All patients recovered except one adult. He was declared unrecoverable and moved immediately into stasis storage before any additional damage can occur. This is standard policy.

We should be expecting to move them back where they belong. I made a decision to also dump the dead male body as well. I am not dealing with dangerous ninjas.

Addendum: I got yet into another argument with Rin about moving them back or not. She was very insistent on taking care of them, not just their physical health, but also mental health as well. I also pointed out that they are trained killers and missing-nins. She argued back against me that we don't know their history and who they are. We kept arguing back and forth, sometime in circles.

Finally, the commander made the tie-breaking decision to take a chance to end the argument.

I warned Rin that ninjas are very dangerous, even if they don't have aura.

**Year 2: Day 205**

The ninja team woke up, did a tearful union, and requested to see their dead teammate.

It took three hours for the translator to communicate the concept of a stasis pod, information theoretic death, and the prospect of reviving the dead.

They didn't quite believe it, but they were half of a mind wanting to do a burial.

**Year 2: Day 208**

We have set a wedding day, since we never actually conducted the ceremony.

**Year 2: Day 210**

Interrogation yielded a wealth of information about the planet. It isn't the Elemental Nations as I know it, though my memory of the series was very rusty and didn't really extend to the fourth shinobi world war.

**Year 2: Day 213**

Us Earthlings got together for a day.

Blue is a lot less grumpy now, and more laid back. He said he won't go back to Beacon Academy. The former student is actually studying aeronautical engineering.

Whittle is abrasive as ever and is a workacholic. He tended to bring his work into his free time.

Anyway, we compared stories about Earth. It seemed that we all come from the same Earth, or at least similar enough details. Whittle mentioned something about a spike in disappearances before reappearing on Remnant three years ago.

Blue said he didn't remember much since it was seventeen years ago for him.

**Year 2: Day 225**

I offered the redhead ninja a deal to become my agent. She accepted it.

With that agreement, they automatically granted asylum.

The genin are forbidden from combat until they reach of age when schoolchildren started hunting monsters, which will not be very long, actually. They'll be schooled and trained with special operation at Stargate Command.

Eventually, the genin will attend public school and have normal friendships.

The ninjas are to receive mandatory counseling for their PTSD and other mental trauma.

**Year 2: Day 226**

Rin and I had a long discussion with the redhead(her name is basically unpronounceable to us) and her students about what her duties will entails, what we want, and what they want.

We knew that they are operatives for Jiraiya(whose real name is also unpronounceable), and we expressed no interest in conquering the Elemental Nations nor would we want to interact with them anytime soon. Our interest is in chakra and sealings, with altruism on the side.

We are willing to offer her team limited uplift packages, but we made it clear that we regarded the ninjas as a powerful threat.

It is mostly on her team to make it work.

In the meantime, I required the redhead's service on Remnant.

I need spies, and if her stories is true, then she is very good at infiltration and espionage. While she can't teach people to henge, she can teach people to lie, steal, and seduce.

**Year 2: Day 234**

Did a demo day with my R&D staff.

Some highlights of the day:

* **Shield generator MK II**: Next generation shield with better energy consumption, in addition to mass and volume reduction. All that means is that power armor users will pack either more shields or something else, bringing back the mass back to where it was before.

* **Prototype hardsuit**: It's basically is power armor, but much of the mass is shaved off in exchange for agility. Some huntsmen do use power armor and really move well in it. The armor usually took a beating for such heavy usage. It also exhausts huntsmen faster.

* **Mechacycle MK I**: A prototype ground unit that can run on four legs and can also transforms into a motorcycle. With sensor fusion and integration with battlefield network, it can anticipate and adjust its movements for obstacles ahead of time. The researchers that built was understandingly veyr excited about this, but the engineer in Rin and I died a little.  It's a very complex war machine, and I worried about its reliability and manufacturability.

* **Corvette airship**: Yet to be named; it is a long endurance airship three times as big as bullhead with speed up to only two hundred kilometers per hours. It is mostly a platform for learning how to build and design airships.

**Year 2: day 244**

I went to Beacon Academy incognito to discuss Salem's location with Ozpin.

There are deep black spot on the map that seemed to have indicated large concentration of Grimm. One spot happens to be near to my kingdom. The joy.

Anyway, Ozpin thanked me for informing information, even though he said that there's no way he's going to get his huntsmen near any of those black spots.

I thought about nuking all the black spots, but I don't need the political headaches. There's also no guarantee that Salem will be there in any of those locations, and there's a good chance that the black spots might just re-emerge, wasting our nuclear weapon for the price of a pandora's box.

If we know where Salem is, I might be less hesitant in nuking.
