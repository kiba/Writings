**Year 3, Day 174**

What a horrific year. It seemed that the Grimm never stopped attacking or letting up, but eventually they finally gave up.

I was so busy that I wasn't able to write anything in my journal for months. Most of my time were spent with my generals and industrial operation, while also fighting fires as with the worldwide recession and increasing social unrest. It's not fun.

**Year 3, Day 175**

Our population actually shrank, due to the loss of faith in Mechatron's defenses.

Three thousand people lost their lives in the fighting, mostly military and milita. We lost an additional fifteen thousand citizens to migration.

Thankfully, the kingdoms, mostly Atlas, sent troops to aid in the fighting and evacuation, but it was a pittance to what I was able to field.

Most devastatingly, the enemy were able to chop away my logistical support, destroying my access to most bastions.

They tried an all out effort to destroy Dawn and Allothmy during the closing month of the war. I thought I had to execute plan Omega for general evacuation of my people to the underground and then through the stargate.

Then the enemy just melted away at the last second.

I am still improving plan Omega should that becomes necessary.

**Year 3, Day 178**

I attended a peace summit and made it clear to everyone that I would start developing strategic weapons. In particular, that would be nuclear weapons.

The kingdoms pleaded to me that I shouldn't do that, and that I should remember what happened to the Moon.

It is moot. If I were able to nuke the Grimm, I wouldn't hemorrhage so many people to migration and almost lost my aboveground kingdom.

For better or worse, they walked away with no demand to restrict rods of god, nuclear bombs, or any other weapons of massive destructive power.

But boy did it cause a shitstorm and controversy throughout Remnant.

**Year 3, Day 181**

The department of statistics and information tallied up how many people we lost to migration. Most of them are not in the government, and they're mostly humans.

The faunus for the most part decided to stick with my kingdom rather than fleeing.

**Year 3, Day 185**

General Ironwood approached me to purchase war machines, and in particular bullets, as well all the blueprints to create the machines that manufacture them. They will pay royalties if they should decide to produce those machines and bullets in their own factories.

It's actually much cheaper and more efficient to buy from me rather than start up their own factories.

The general commented on how my war machines made their mech obsolete overnight and that they were trying to catch up, but he was under no illusion over who has the greatest manufacturing capacity.

It is a five year contract in which I will supply the Atlasian military with the latest and greatest military hardware, with the manual, blueprints along with training services. It's some serious lien that will go to support my SWF.

**Year 3, 199**

Other kingdoms are approaching me to buy military hardware as well. They are very afraid of what might happen to them.

The Grimm literally did fought Mechatron to a standstill, the micro kingdom that is the premiere military power on Remnant. If the Grimm did try to attack any other kingdoms, a lot more people will die, and maybe the kingdom would disappear altogether.

I wonder why Salem chose my kingdom rather than the others? Maybe she thought that I was going to become very difficult to destroy as time go on.

**Year 3, 210**

We finally got the first dust rocket engine design tested at the SETO test center. I sent Frank's team cakes for a job well done.

**Year 3, 222**

Summit of Strategic Weapons happened.

* Strategic weapons are banned from use against any kingdoms, including any population centers such as towns or cities.

* All kingdoms shall be informed of strategic weapon research taken by other kingdoms.

* The use of strategic weapons shall only be authorized against existential threats and enemies of mankind.

By the way, I twisted the wording broadly enough to allow the use of strategic weapons to be used against Goa'uld and tailed beasts and so on.

We didn't get anything down regarding enforcement of the Strategic Weapon Treaty. It's all based on a gentleman's agreement for now.

Some of the kingdoms wanted to use independent huntsmen for enforcement. I basically said, "fuck no", not without further vetting. The last thing I want is a Salem plot waiting to happen.

**Year 3, 230**

Attended a secret meeting with Ozpin. Learned more about Salem but not enough to be useful.

I told him I need to know the extent of Salem's capacity, because she might try another large scale invasion again, and it might not be my kingdom.

Ozpin said he can't work miracle, and that he is already trying very hard to find out more about Salem.

Very frustrating.

**Year 3, 233**

Second Summit on Strategic Weapons took place.

We finally hashed out further rules and policies. Each nations can build as many strategic weapons as they want, but they will be guarded and operated by all Kingdoms' militaries, who will all be stringently vetted.

The use of strategic weapons can only be authorized by designated individuals, such as the sovereign ruler or the council. The security will then decide if they shall carry out the order.

I noted that this would never have happened on Earth, but it's clear that the fear of the Grimm won out over the fear of Mechatron's as a military power.

The attitudes of the kingdoms toward Mechatron changed, but they wanted to make sure that nobody will destroy a kingdom through accident or malignant uses.

I think we might be seeing the birth of a world government.

**Year 3, 237**

Immigration reversed course. People are coming back now.

**Year 3, 244**

Jaune Arc decided to enter special operation training.

**Year 3, 250**

Rin and I discussed the merits of opening up the Stargate program to everyone else.

**Year 3, 255**

MSC discovered the Nox homeworld.

We almost got kicked out.

Sending sociologists and professors and try to chitchat up with Nox.

So far nothing useful other than advices for mediation and comments about how unusual my people are.

**Year 3, 260**

The Mantle Queen made a visit. Told us that she got enough spectral dust to make a portal. We knew that. She knew we knew, and so on.

Then we have tea, talking about various topics. Then at some point, she tried to suggest multiple marriages, but Rin subtly shut her down. I want to stay away from that crazy woman.

After she left, I told my MSC commander to prep a stargate team for a trip to Atlas.

**Year 3, 266**

All three rocket designs are coming along. We should see them by the end of the year.

**Year 3, 275**

Got confirmation of a portal to Earth.
