# Chapter Seventeen: Project Sanctuary

**Year 2, Day 250**

Wedding preparation kicked into high gear. The queen of Mantle dropped in for tea and making sure that we're not an embarrassment to all royals.

Ugh.

As nice as she is, I remembered her desire to overthrow the Atlasian military oligarchy.

**Year 2, Day 253**

Invitation are going out. We have a very few that we would considered friends and families, but there are lot of VIPs that will attend, like royals and councilmembers.

**Year 2, Day 263**

By now, the MSC(Mechatron Stargate Command) explored a dozen of planets, but not any new habitable worlds beside the Elemental Nations, and we're definitely not going to colonize that world. The people there are very dangerous, and there would be hell to pay to try to invade and take over their land. We'll wait until we're sufficiently powerful enough to deal with some of their more bullshit ninjas there.

We're going to keep exploring until we find a habitable world to colonize.

By then, I think we probably have to go international. If the Goa'uld are out there, then they could wipe us out from orbit.

We need to colonize a planet that's not in the Goa'uld territory, and then start stealing technologies so that we can build capital ships to protect Remnant.

That will lead to the creation of a true united polity across Remnant in which I lose power, but I think I am OK with that. I am already having issues in running a small kingdom, thank you very much.

**Year 2, Day 264**

Blue and Frank created the Earth Diaspora Society and invited me to join. I accepted.

It's a very exclusive club that's going to be careful in testing for memberships. We aren't going to release information to the public about Earth so that we can identify people using knowledge that only Earthlings have, rather than wade through fakers.

**Year 2, Day 265**

I talked to my prime minister about setting up a basic income for all citizenry and building a sovereign wealth fund.

The minister and his economic adviser said it will make me more 'socialist' than I am already am. I don't give a fuck about political classification.

The details basically says I need a lot of money and fiscal discipline. I wonder how will I find any money since we're already spending almost all the lien on military, infrastructure, and R&D expenditure.

**Year 2, Day 268**

Better than nothing. I bled two percent of profit from selling power armors and diverted the income into the SWF. We'll withdraw one percent of the dividend generated, and reinvest everything else.

Anybody shall be free to donate to the SWF. I know I am.

Eventually, I want to be able to run the entire government only on the SWF. However, the implication is that the investment fund will be monstrous, which implies a very large private sector.

Governments are usually very monstrous in budget, partly because they're inefficient in the allocation of resource, but also because they provide a wide variety of services.

Somehow, I am not hopeful about building a SWF that can provide my citizenry with a sustainable income.

**Year 2, Day 272**

The Mantle Queen came again.

She discussed a project that she wanted my funding for and needed my help with. It's something about spectral dust that could bend the law of physics and reality itself.

I asked if she was trying to make a bomb to blow up Atlas. She looked at me funny and laughed loudly. She lend me tantalizing notes on how spectral dust works, hinting that she will give information if I cooperate with her.

The queen made it clear that her intention was not to violently overthrow the Atlastian government but to gain enough power and prestige so that she can regain, peacefully, what was rightfully her. They cannot really try her for treason if all she did was fund a really cool science project.

One way to do that is to use the spectral dust for interdimensional travel to a primitive sanctuary. Apparently, it was from a legend thousand years in the making, discovered by an archaeological expedition that she funded from her own pocket.

I thought it was unlikely that such a sanctuary would remain primitive over thousand of years. Things can change very quickly. She said she never thought of that possibility, and would agree to take that into account. The last thing we want to do is start a war.

I made it clear that I am not involving myself in any attempt to overthrow the Atlasian government, or to make a bomb, or any other of that bullshit.

She laughed again, saying that she liked me for such strength of will and integrity. If it weren't for Rin, she would try to date and marry me instead. She also has no problem complying with my demands, because she wasn't trying to do these things anyway.

Her offer still stand for the next twenty days.

I am very suspicious of her, so I ordered my ninja to start packing and build a spy network in Atlas and Mantle.

**Year 2, Day 283**

The Arc matriarch arrived in town. How did I know that?

The matriarch arrived, tracked down her son, scolded him, hugged him, and then demanded a meeting with me.

Curious, I greeted her. She then demanded an explanation as to why her son was in my military instead of attending Beacon Academy. Then she started crying about how proud she was of her son and how she didn't want him to be a huntsman, intentionally never giving her son any opportunities to learn how to fight.

Anyway, once the meeting was finished, I was somewhat bewildered.

**Year 2, Day 288**

Our spymaster already turned up something useful. It was a whole lot of political bullshit that my Prime Minister could exploit but I don't care to do.

Now we have a series of paid informers feeding us information back about the political happening of Atlas.

With some discussion, Rin and I also agreed to Project Sanctuary. Our spymaster is already back training some of the handpicked researchers on how to spy and gather information.

**Year 2, Day 291**

The Mantle queen visited us again. She thanked us for agreeing to the project.

Then more royals and dignitaries from other kingdoms arrived. The wedding is now kicking into full gear.

The wedding was also an excuse for a cultural festival. The population boomed three times to its normal size. Stampede became a huge worry for security, as well as the threat of terrorist attacks and plots by Salem.

**Year 2, Day 294**

Very tiring. No time for science.

Spymaster doing a very good job with her henge, learning juicy details that I don't want to care about but my minister would happily exploit.

In the meantime, we're trying small talk and sticking to what the public already know about us.

**Year 2, Day 299**

Last day rehearsal before the actual wedding ceremony.

**Year 2, Day 300**

Wedding day. Wish me luck.
