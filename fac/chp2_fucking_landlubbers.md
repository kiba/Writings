I groaned in pain as the console beeped so many annoying sounds.

The console shown that there was massive structural damage from the shuttle, especially the bottom and the front of the ship. Thankfully, I was well protected since I was located near the core of the ship.

The rocket engines were thankfully not totaled, but it means zip with the loss of structural integrity and insufficient fuels.

Fuck.

It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

We were supposed to mine the asteroids for materials and then colonize this system. Why avail yourself to a gravity well when you could live in space? Alas, we made a serious navigation error. Or I suspected, a deliberate navigation error.

Some people just has this raging boner for living on planets, no matter the disadvantage.

In any case, it led to a series of unlikely events that forced me to depart via shuttle. I was planning to land on its moon, look for ice and propellent, and then mine it.

Now the colony ship got no fuels in orbit to move, never mind land.

Fucking landlubbers.

I unstrapped myself from my crash couch, then made my way to the cargo bay.

Thankfully, the bay was full of equipment that I can use to jumpstart an industrial economy, from the extreme basic of simply smelting the metals. I also have a storage of 'vitamins', which I needed to use wisely or otherwise I am going to run out of control units.

It's the only way to get off this planet. I'll have to replicate an entire industrial economy, from scratch.

I just hope the landlubbers up there don't break things in their colony ship, or otherwise we're going to have problem propagating this cadet branch of humanity.
