# Chapter Five: A New Bastion

**Day 121**

We had a brief argument about pollution and biters. I was proud of polluting and killing biters, but Rin pointed out that I was spiting my own nose. Who wants to deal with a constant attack coming from biters, anyway?

Why I have improved my knowledge of logistics and production, I don't really have any useful skills in actually engineering anything, so I can't clean up pollutions from my smelters and other machines.

What I can do is transit from coal to clean energy. It's very trivial for me to start manufacturing solar panels and producing them. Likewise, I have no problem in manufacturing accumulators as well, which stores energy and help deal with the variability of solar power generation.

Rin has all the skills I could ever want in a person. She somehow was able to accumulate a general skillset to engineer anything, but there is a limit to how fast she can engineer. She would be able to go faster if she has certain information.

Sadly, the information was stuck in Remnan computers from before the fall, and not necessary transferrable to Factorio's computers, which ran a Linux distro. Rin Furukawa wasn't as good as programming as I am, so I was enlisted in the project to reverse engineer and make it possible to transfer information.

It's a lot easier to reverse engineer if you have the required complete documentation for both source, but it was still a lot of work.

In the evening, Rin wanted to know all about RWBY. I obliged.

She thought the story and weapons are silly, and she REALLY wanted aura. Like, REALLY WANT, and semblance as well.

We have shields, but they aren't powered by our souls.

**Day 123**

Based on Rin Furukawa's estimation of city size, I began working on tunneling to what I think is the edge. My plan is to build a solid wall that the Grimm can't easily tunnel through.

Meanwhile, I already built a railway to my forward operating base, which I now named Bastion Alpha for short.

I am building a fortress, the place mostly empty except for the solar panels and the accumulators. I elevated them because I knew that I am going to have building beneath the panels. The solar power really helped with the industrial process below.

I am also storing war machines there as well, ready to rush out at a moment notice.

Attacks are coming at sporadic moments, and it seemed like that I will never get rid of them.

**Day 125**

My store of factorio blueprints unfortunately don't have a design for actual long range aircraft.

So I ripped a design from the civilizational toolkit, added transceiver, autopilot, and camera and called it a day.

I got it to fly, sort of. It crashed fifteen seconds later. I could really use an aerospace engineer here.

**Day 130**

There's way too much work for the both of us here. I am working on three different projects through out the day. My girlfriend doing three projects too.

No matter what we do, we have to proceed until we find more people.

I created Bastion Beta. Every twenty kilometers, we're creating a new fortress to gain a foothold in this land. It's also more space to store my military equipment and generate more power.

**Day 133**

HIP HIP HOORAY! A prospecting TBM found dusts. Ice type variety. Rin explained to me that the city of Allothmy was founded on a dust-rich mine. Over the centuries, her people dug deeper and deeper, while the city above grew. Eventually, the underground became part of the city in its own right, but they never stopped digging even on the day that she was frozen.

If I found one of the mining tunnels, there should be a rich vein of dust to follow, continuing where they left off.

I had no idea how to mine it safely, so I left it alone until my girlfriend find the time to take a look at our mining equipment and our processes.

**Day 138**

I built a specialized robot recycling facility. The Grimm just won't stop attacking. As long as my army grow faster than they can destroy, I am good.

**Day 145**

Finally, we reached the plain, or at least a lot less trees. I was getting fairly annoyed by the trees after a while.

Also Rin finished her design on air filtration and smokestack screening. We outfit all the appropriate machinery with smokestack filters, and then piped all of those to a dedicated area for further filtration, which by the way required a lot of industrial machinery.

Anyway, pollution? DONE. It required a lot of power, though.

My girlfriend is truly a force of nature.

She's working next on cleaning up the posion in our environment.

Our power armors did the protecting part, and we have airlocks dedicated to cleaning our armor of heavy metal and other hazardous contamination. So she should find something to adapt, but we have no idea how hard the engineering task will be.

**Day 149**

Today's no work day. We relax and did nothing.

**Day 153**

Finally! We were able to get data to the machine. Lot of copying involved.

**Day 157**

My scout plane can fly now! But then it crashed in less a day. Oh well.

**Day 163**

A major attack on Bastion Alpha!

The grimms are repelled by the end of the day by sheer DAKKA. This is what happens when you parked one hundred Doom buggies on empty concrete(covered by solar panels).

**Day 166**

I know I been really slow at expanding, but a lot of my time is spent on furnishing each bastions, and working back in the hub world. Rin for some reason want to call the hub world the Machine World, despite the existence of biters. I supposed I have to make it true.

Anyway, I triangulated the location of the nearest large source of radio transmission. It actually isn't that far from here.

But I only built sixty kilometers and three bastions.

**Day 167**

What got me REALLY excited was unknown contacts coming on my radar. Since the grimm are in the databank, and I usually engage with surface to air missiles.

However, those unknown contacts are all sharp angles and stuff. Clearly man-made. It was automatically not-shoot.

The unknown aircrafts tried to make radio contact, which took me a while to figure out the frequency they were using. Then I signaled them back with morse code, which they can interpret as pattern. They landed some distance away, and set up a camp. Then we started talking over radio until we find a language we both mutually understand.

We made first contact with them once they approached Bastion Charles.
