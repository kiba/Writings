# Chapter Twenty-three: Contact

**Year 3, Day 277**

The Atlasian ambassador was really angry with us.

We had to listen to him bitch at us and the queen of Mantle for thirty minutes straight.

I was about to punch him in the face, but my lovely wife stayed my hand.

**Year 3, Day 278**

The Atlasian government came and swept the Mantle Queen's secret project.

We didn't hear anything from the queen even with our assets, but we assumed that she has something up her sleeves.

**Year 3, Day 281**

General Ironwood arrived.

We have a long talk about what we should do with the spectral project and the Earth portal.

I replied that I already have a command dedicated to exploration, and already prepped one of my operator extensively for Earth. He wondered why I already have explorers.

I revealed a big secret to him: the stargate program.

Rin and I knew that we have to do it soon or later. The stargate is the concerns of the entirety of Remnant, especially the Goa'uld threat that might or might not be lurking out there.

Ironwood was taken back by it, but he's intrigued enough to send some specialists my way, but he also said he will mention this project to Ozpin.

I told him that I don't want to let Salem knows.

**Year 3, Day 283**

We finally sent in an agent to Earth.

He has to rescue people from a thirteen cars pile-up wreck.

Anyway, he found a probable Remnan, which he knew from his own aura sense, but also his scroll. We got the entire interaction recorded via a hidden cam on his tie.

Running the software through recognition...and guess what we found? Summer Rose. She was presumed dead thirteen years ago when she failed to return.

It is by no mean assured, but this woman is very likely Summer Rose.

Moving on, the agent caused a shitstorm of media attention. The FBI converged on the scene to interview our agent, the national guard dispatched, and so on.

By no means that they will discover our world is Remnant, just yet.

**Year 3, Day 284**

Everyone is hurrying to fly in representatives to Atlas as fast as they could.

**Year 3, Day 285**

The Earthlings are intimidated by the obviously better equipped and technological superior honor guards present at the first contact meeting.

**Year 3, Day 287**

They finally discovered what fictional universe we're form. God, this is so entertaining to watch.

**Year 3, Day 290**

Back to business, the Americans formed a formidable fortress around the remote gate.

They're very cautious about letting any Grimm seep through.

**Year 3, Day 291**

The Earth Diaspora Society got a whole lot attention, as well unfavorable attention for Blue.

Jaune Arc got unfavorable attention as well.

I stepped down my foot and said that those two individuals had redeemed themselves in the eyes of Mechatron. Jaune Arc is undergoing special operation training and Blue proved to be an able aerospace engineer.

**Year 3, Day 294**

I told Remnant not to join the United Nations as they're a completely toothless organization and an utter waste of time.

**Year 3, Day 297**

We finally agreed to a treaty. No expansion or creation of any portal without Earth's permission. Each side shall be responsible for the defense of those portals to prevent any Grimm incursion.

Trade and other policies shall be decided at a later date.

**Year 3, Day 298**

Team BRWY is now renamed RWBY.

They also became really famous in two world.

Plus the Ozpin conspiracy group is exposed. Oops.

**Year 3, Day 300**

The Queen of Mantle finally got a small concession from Atlas. She will be able to keep a portion of tourist income earned in Mantle for her own benefit. Money is power.

**Year 3, Day 302**

Ozpin got heckled and hounded by the media. Everyone knows about the maiden now. Everyone also want to know what other secrets Ozpin and his group are hiding. I am not sure what we do now since Salem is now known to everyone as a real legend.

**Year 3, Day 305**

Ozpin got called to hearing for some grilling. He managed to say essentially nothing while saying a whole lot of things.

**Year 3, Day 306**

Finally, we made a breakthrough with the Nox. They want to know about the Grimm problem we have and see if they can fix it.

They arranged a visit date of 'your two weeks'.

I am worried about having alien visitors on my planet. Do they even understand the value of disguise?

Anyway, I told them what they need to know and that we're not responsible for their death if they're careless about confronting the Grimm.

**Year 3, Day 310**

Frank's rocket made its maiden flight. The whole of Remnant watched. And it somehow didn't...explode.

God damn. This is just...impressive work. One hundred metric ton to Low Earth Orbit, and we're working on a fully reusable variant.

Anyway, we got a really big satellite in low earth orbit with high power radio transmission.

The production rate is only one per week due to quality control and the learning curve. We need time before we can ramp it up to a rocket a day, but only if we stop iterating.

The SETO council is considering canceling the other rockets. Rin argued that we should keep those designs for the time being until we have five years operational history for the learning experience.

We'll see if the other two will have to go the way of the dodo bird. As it is, the other researchers are starting to be agitated about working on a clearly inferior rocket.

**Year 3, Day 320**

A few Nox came, disguised as regular humans, with no nature thingy.

It's a good thing that I practiced a lot of mediation and philosophy. Rin, on the other hand, just didn't want to do it all.

You see, they like to grill my MSC exploration teams on matter of wisdoms, and then forced them to mediate for seven hours. It's maddening!

We'll see what the Nox will have to say about the Grimm.
