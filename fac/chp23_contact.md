# Chapter Twenty-three: Contact

**Year 3, Day 277**

The Atlasian ambassador was really angry with us.

We had to listen to him bitch at us and the queen of Mantle for thirty minutes straight.

I was about to punch him in the face, but my lovely wife stayed my hand.

**Year 3, Day 278**

The Atlasian government came and swept the Mantle Queen's secret project.

We didn't hear anything from the queen even with our assets, but we assumed that she has something up her sleeves.

**Year 3, Day 281**

General Ironwood arrived.

We have a long talk about what we should do with the spectral project and the Earth portal.

I replied that I already have a command dedicated to exploration, and already prepped one of my operator extensively for Earth. He wondered why I already have explorers.

I revealed a big secret to him: the stargate program.

Rin and I knew that we have to do it soon or later. The stargate is the concerns of the entireity of Remnant, especially the Goa'uld threat that might or might not be lurking out there.

Ironwood was taken back by it, but he's intrigued enough to send some specialists my way, but he also said he will mention this project to Ozpin.

I told him that I don't want to let Salem knows.
