# Chapter Eight: A New Beginning

Jaune Arc failed to get into the Beacon Academy. The admission officer found out that he faked his transcript. Ashamed at his behavior and failure to get in, the former huntsman-to-be didn't even return home to face his parents or his sisters.

He didn't even have the heart to lie to caravans for a job when he headed out for the new "frontier".

That was how he ended up, alone, in Dawnson on the street, looking for a place to stay and a job. His pocket was very empty. The town seemed to be bursting at the seam, because of the recent population boom.

A lot of construction seemed to be brand new, some seemed to be specializing in selling Mechatron's goods, which was the name of the local 'kingdom' nearby.

He noticed that there are people who are demonstrating with signage. Something about annexation, and something about staying free. There were even heckling and arguing between two groups. The wandering teenager didn't pretend to understand the political subtlety.

Finally, he found a "help wanted." That was what he was looking for!

Jaune Arc's stomach tighten as he thought back to the forged transcript. That wasn't relevant, he thought to himself. He was just looking for a job, not trying to get into a huntsman academy by cheating.

He walked up to the shopkeeper, a man with thick muscular frame with a fairly full beard.

"Ex-ex-excuse me, I am looking for a job," Arc said, trying to hold back the panic enveloping his body.

The shopkeeper eyed the teenager with appraisal. "I sell weapons. Do you know weapons?"

"Um...yes?"

"Answer those five very easy to answer questions, and I'll train you even if you don't know much."

"Ok...."

"All guns include the four basic parts such as...."

"Ummm..."

"Five seconds."

Arc utterly failed to answer during the following five seconds. He never handled a gun in his life!

"You failed my cursory interview," the shopkeeper concluded.

"But...but I need a job! How am I going to feed myself?"

"Tough luck, kid. I can find a more qualified candidate by just waiting until the end of the day. Either find a job that you can do, or go to Allothmy for a handout. By the way, I was feeling particularly generous this time by lowballing the interview. A word of advice, if you don't even know the parts of a gun, then you got no business wearing that armor and sword. You probably never even fought anything seriously."

Jaune Arc, sighed, aghast at his ignorance and performance. The shopkeeper was right. What was he trying to do?

Even with the abundance of job opportunities in this town, he was passed over by other more assertive job applicants, or that the jobs required skills and experience that Jaune Arc didn't have. The employers were supposed to be hiring, but that apparently didn't apply to him.

Eventually, the next day, Arc went to Allothmy, first by walking to one of their walled fortress. Then he hopped on a train designated for the city. There, he hoped for a job.

When he arrived at the Allothmy train station, there was a sign stating the city name and population numbers. There were only six hundred people in the Kingdom? It was only two months since the kingdom had shown up, but Jaune Arc was desperate.

Outside of the train station, there were shops and kiosk. Amazing that a town can pop up in just two months.

"Everyone who needs an apartment, come this way!" a wolf faunus boy said. "Come this away."

Well, what was Jaune Arc waiting for? He came to the frontier because that there were things happening. He thought he might be able to make a living, rather than staying in Vale and getting a job there. It was apparently not in Dawnson, but here, hopefully?

***

Arc got an apartment,fifty square meters of space to just himself. Roomy. There were rumors on the CCTS network that there are free apartments, daily rationing, and a power armor suit, but he never thought those rumors to be actual facts.

Though, the rationing was very plain. Not a whole lot of taste, but at least he wasn't starving.

But Jaune Arc didn't have a job yet. That was what he wanted, not free stuff. He felt that he earned nothing for it. He didn't even understand why Allothmy decided to give away free stuff for nothing.

He'll have to get out there...and get a job.

Jaune Arc stared at the sign of a military information kiosk.

"JOIN THE NEW ARMY! FAST TRACK TO CITIZENSHIP! NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED!" it said.

He had no idea that they need an army in the first place. He thought that they don't need someone to manage the war machines in this place? Then again, when he found a reliable source of information, he learned that the kingdom is so rich that they can afford to give away space. They were also desperate for manpower, especially for engineers and scientists, but they'll take anybody they can get. Already, the first settling family got a job as a manager. Everyday, there were more people working for the government to manage the kingdom's affairs.

Still, he couldn't figure out why they need an army of people when they can just throw robots at it.

"Well blondie, are you going to ask?" the man managing the information kiosk said.

"Umm...why do they need soldiers for if they got robots to do everything?"

"Robots are like your scrolls or your computers," the man replied. "They don't have an ounce of intelligence in them for all the algorithms that is built into them. Those robots can fight the grimm because there was somebody behind the curtain orchestrating their strings. There are jobs that only humans can fulfill."

"Oh. Will I be controlling them?"

"Maybe. The emperor hadn't say anything. We are just starting to form a military organization. He didn't want to stay committed so soon. However, he did say that it will involve a lot of bootcamp, marching, and camping, just like any other military in the world. Are you ready for that?"

Arc didn't feel the need to answer the question. He asked his own questions instead. "What's the pay? What's the benefit?"

Why was he doing this? Jaune Arc still wanted to be a hero and slay monsters. He figured that he can learn how to be a soldier in this place, and maybe get into Beacon Academy based on his experience in the Mechatron army?
