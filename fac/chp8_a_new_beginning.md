# Chapter Eight: A New Beginning

Jaune Arc failed to get into the Beacon Academy. The admission officer found out that he faked his transcript. Ashamed at his behavior, he didn't return home to face his parents or his sisters.

He didn't even have the heart to lie to caravans for a job when he headed out for the new "frontier".

That was how he ended up, alone, in Dawnson on the street, looking for a place to stay and a job. His pocket were empty. The town seemed to be bursting at the seam, as it experienced population growth.
