# Chapter Eight: A New Beginning

Jaune Arc failed to get into the Beacon Academy. The admission officer found out that he faked his transcript. Ashamed at his behavior, he didn't return home to face his parents or his sisters.

He didn't even have the heart to lie to caravans for a job when he headed out for the new "frontier".

That was how he ended up, alone, in Dawnson on the street, looking for a place to stay and a job. His pocket were empty. The town seemed to be bursting at the seam, as it experienced population growth.

A lot of construction seemed to be brand new, some seemed to be specializing in selling Mechatron's goods, which was the name of the local 'kingdom' nearby.

He noticed political demonstration signs. Something about annexation, and something about staying free. People were shouting over each other over arguments that the teenager don't feel fully.

Finally, he found a "help wanted." That was what he was looking for!

Jaune Arc's stomach tighten as he thought back to the forged transcript. That wasn't relevant, he thought to himself. He was just looking for a job, not trying to get into a huntsman academy.

He walked up to the shopkeeper, a man with thick muscular frame with a fairly full beard.

"Ex-ex-excuse me, I am looking for a job," Arc said, trying to hold back the panic enveloping his body.

The shopkeeper eyed the teenager with appraisal. "I sell weapons. Do you know weapons?"

"Um...yes?"

"Answer those five very easy to answer questions, and I'll train you even if you don't know much."

"Ok...."

"All guns include the four basic parts such as...."

"Ummm..."

"Five seconds."

Arc utterly failed to answer during the following five seconds. He never handled a gun in his life!

"You failed my cursory interview," the shopkeeper concluded.

"But...but I need a job! How am I going to feed myself?"

"Tough luck, kid. I can find a more qualified candidate by just waiting until the end of the day. Either find a job that you can do, or go to Allothmy for a handout. By the way, I was feeling particularly generous this time by lowballing the interview. A word of advice, if you don't even know the parts of a gun, then you got no business wearing that armor and sword. You probably never even fought anything seriously."

Jaune Arc, sighed, aghast at his ignorance and performance. The shopkeeper was right. What was he trying to do?

Even with the abundance of job opportunities in this town, he was passed over by other more assertive job applicants, or that the jobs required skills and experience that Jaune Arc didn't have. The employers were supposed to be hiring, but that apparently didn't apply to him.

Eventually, the next day, Arc went to Allothmy, first by walking to one of their walled fortress. Then he hopped on a train designated for the city. There, he hoped for a job.

When he arrived at the Allothmy train station, there was a sign stating the city name and population numbers. There were only six hundred people in the Kingdom? It was only two months since the kingdom had shown up, but Jaune Arc was desperate.

Outside of the train station, there were shops and kiosk. Amazing that a town can pop up two months.

"Everyone who needs an apartment, come this way!" a wolf faunus boy said. "Come this away."

Well, what was Jaune Arc waiting for? He came to the frontier because that there were things happening. He thought he might be able to make a living, rather than staying in Vale and getting a job there. It was apparently not in Dawnson, but here, hopefully?

***

Arc got an apartment. As proof of this, he got fifty square meters of space to himself. Roomy. There were rumors on the CCTS network that there are free apartments, daily rationing, and a power armor suit, but he never thought those rumors to be actual facts.

Though, the rationing was very plain. Not a whole lot of taste, but it was what he needed to live for now.

But Jaune Arc didn't have a job yet. That was what he wanted, not free stuff. He felt that he earned nothing for it. He didn't even understand why Allothmy decided to give away free stuff for nothing.

He'll have to get out there...and get a job.
