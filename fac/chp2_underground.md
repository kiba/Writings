# Chapter Two: Underground

The "GO" fever grew stronger with each passing minute. I really want to meet people, but I wasn't stupid enough to simply stumble into the stargate and hope for the best. I sent in several drones to scout ahead.

The video didn't tell me if I am in or near a kingdom, as it was inside a building.

The drones explored until they reached inaccessible doors. I considered that a mere inconvenience. The doors were cut away by the drones' built-in plasma torch, then the resulting cutouts are then stored in a pocket dimension container. The process repeated itself several times until the drones reach the limit of radio range.

The place was very dark, with no windows or any working lights. The only source of illumination were the drones. It seemed to be an abandoned building. The strongest evidences were the creepy mummified remains of long expired human beings. All the pipes were rusted, and all the books has decayed to unreadable nothingness. Yet, there were no Grimm to worry about.

I think the people of Remnant has no access to whatever this place is. Those unidentified bodies would be buried or placed in museum. Maybe the Grimm don't have access either. I think Salem wouldn't like those bodies ever.

***

I stepped over. Immediately, I regretted it. There was no one there according to my chirping drones, but that didn't mean that it's actually safe.

Nonetheless, I didn't go back. Instead, I began expanding radio transceivers out from the stargate, increasing my drones' exploration range. Meanwhile, I placed turrets in spaces where I can, as cramped this place was. I don't want to die from the Grimm.

***

It wasn't long until I discovered a very interesting room.

Unlike all the other rooms, this place was active, brimming with energy. I could see it as clear as day on the drones' thermal vision.

More importantly, there are HUMAN BEINGS!

Despite my earlier caution, I rushed to that room as soon as I can.

***

It is a stasis chamber, with a power core that is completely separate from the rest of the building. I knew that because the door leading to it described this room in English.

Everything around the chamber decayed and became broken, this room didn't. I didn't know how they did it, but at the moment, I didn't care.

It stored a total of fifty pods in arranged in a semi-circle against the circular walls, with two pods for each portion of the wall.

"Wow," I said as I walk toward one of them.

I decided to pull on a handle, which then revealed a beautiful woman in her mid twenty, dressed in a lab coat, sporting blue shoulder length hairs and red eyes. She looked really scared, one of her arms floating, as if she was about to strike against the stasis chamber itself.

There was a touchscreen on the side, with an ON and OFF buttons to click on, and a status display.

HOLY COW! Five thousand years??? Maybe they use a different calendar.

It can't be wrong can it?

Almost immediately, my right hand hovered over the yes button.

I need to press it. I need SOMEBODY. Yet, I couldn't simply press it. What's wrong with me?

I hyperventilated for a good minute. Then I started sweating. What will happen if I press it?

Fifteen minutes passed, and I still haven't pressed it.

"There's nothing that can possibly go wrong, right?" I said out loud, tempting Murphy. Then I willed myself to press it.

The glass pane retracted into the wall.

[DEACTIVATING STASIS FIELD]

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!" the bluehead screamed as soon as the field dropped, her left arm striking against nothing.

Startled, I stepped back as quickly as possible, putting my hands up gesturing a universal sign of surrender.

"Calm down, I am not here to hurt you," I said.

"Where's the hell my father?" she said at the same time.

"I don't know where is your father."

"Who are you? Why do you have your hands up?"

"I don't have a name."

"Why are you not answering?"

"Oh," I said, realizing my mistake. "OK Computer, please activate my voice speaker."

[SPEAKER ACTIVATED]

"Hey, are you mute or something?"

"Can you hear me now?" I spoke.

"Who the hell are you and where is my father?"

"I am an explorer, and I presume your father is either dead or is in one of those stasis pod."

"What? How long time has passed? My father is certainly not dead!"

"Um...five thousand years?" She immediately looked shocked.

Then the woman scramble out of her bed and took a look at the status page.

"NOOOO! It can't be!"

Then the woman started pulling out stasis chambers, most of which were empty. When it was clear that she wasn't going to find anyone, the woman collapsed into the floor.

She sobbed. "It's not...possible! Five thousand years can't have passed!"

What the hell am I supposed to do now? How am I supposed to comfort a woman? In the end, I simply stood still, letting my power armor took up the slack, and waited until the woman stopped crying.

When she was done with the whole crying business, she asked me about the state of the world and what was going on the surface. I simply showed her how I got there, saying that I knew almost nothing about the world above.

"Remnant? That's not the name of my world!" she said. "How would you know about my world anyway?"

I shrugged. "TV show?"

"And how the hell we can speak with each other? How do you know English?"

"Translator microbes?" I said, not sure of the answer.

"Lie."

More questions came inquiring about my background, but there was no satisfactory answer. She told me that I am hiding something.

In spite of her dissatisfaction, I managed to convince her to come back with me, leaving the stasis chambers behind. She stated that the remaining chambers were for terminally ill patients, or patients that were too old.

I took note to explore the underground further. The surface was off limit until I have sufficient DAKKA.

That was how I acquired my first scientist and engineer.
