# Chapter Two: Underground

The "GO" fever was growing stronger minute by minute. I really want to meet people, but I wasn't stupid enough to simply stumble into the stargate and hope for the best. I sent in several drones in for reconnaissance instead.

I thought that I would be outside of one of the four great city-state, but it was clear from the video streaming on the other side that I shouldn't expect that.

I might still be near a kingdom, but I might not be.

The drones are first blocked by inaccessible doors. I considered that a mere inconvenience. Once the doors were cut away, the materials was then stored in one of those pocket dimension containers. The drones continued to expand until they reached their radio range limit.

The place that I am exploring was very dark, with no lightings whatsoever, and no windows. I am pretty sure that it was an abandoned building. The strongest evidence was the creepy mummified remains of long expired human beings. All the pipes were rusted, and all the books has decayed to unreadable nothingness. Yet, there were no Grimm to worry about.

Whatever this place was, I think the people of Remnant has no access to. Those unidentified bodies would be buried or placed in museum.

I stepped over. Immediately, I regretted it. There was no one there according to my chirping drones, but it doesn't mean that it's actually safe.

Nonetheless, I didn't went back. Instead, I began expanding radio transceivers out from the stargate, letting my drones explore. Meanwhile, I placed turrets in spaces where I can, as cramped this place was. I don't want to die from the grimm.

It wasn't long until I discovered a very interesting room.

Unlike all the other rooms, this place was active, brimming with energy. I could see it as clear as day on the drones' thermal vision.

More importantly, there are HUMAN BEINGS!

Despite my earlier caution, I rushed to that room as soon as I can.

***

It is a stasis chamber, with a power core that is completely separate from the rest of the building. I knew that because the door leading to it described this room in English.

Everything around the chamber decayed and became broken, this room didn't. I didn't know how they did it, but at the moment, I didn't care.

It stored a total of fifty pods in arranged in a semi-circle against the circular walls, with two pods for each portion of the wall.

"Wow," I said as I walk toward one of them.

I decided to pull on a handle, which then revealed a beautiful woman in her mid twenty, dressed in a lab coat, sporting blue shoulder length hairs and red eyes. She looked really scared, one of her arms frozen in time, as if she was about to strike against the stasis chamber itself.

There was a touchscreen on the side, with an ON and OFF buttons to click on, and a status display.

Five fucking thousand years???????

It can't be wrong can it?

Almost immediately, my right hand hovered over the yes button.

I need to press it. I need SOMEBODY. Yet, I couldn't simply press it. What's wrong with me.

I hyperventilated for a second there. Then I started sweating. What will happen if I press it?

Fifteen minutes passed, and I still haven't pressed it.

"There's nothing that can possibly go wrong, right?" I said out loud, tempting Murphy. Then I pressed it.

The glass pane retracted into the wall.

[DEACTIVATING STASIS FIELD]

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!" a woman screamed.

Startled, I stepped back as quickly as possible, putting my hands up gesturing a unversial sign of surrender.
