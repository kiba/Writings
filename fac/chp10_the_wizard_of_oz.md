# Chapter Ten: The Wizard of Oz

"Dawnson Peacefully Annexed!"

"The Space Exploration Treaty Organization is Formed."

"Native OS developed by Mechatron Released For Free."

"Trade Complaints Lodged Against Mechatron."

Ozpin scrolled down the headlines related to the new kingdom. There was nothing in his myths and legend that would had foretold its arrival.

Yet, the two founders knew about his secret. The Oz Illuminati they called it. They might have gotten away with their identity, but the headmaster...has...certain resources.

When they agreed to a meeting, he offered to meet them at their capital.

He took a look at his scroll, watching the time. It was already late. Ozpin wasn't about to go back to the academy so soon, so he waited patiently.

Then, the door to the imperial office disgorged power suits that was very common to Mechatron, and nowhere else.

"Ah, welcome," a male voice said. "I am very sorry for that. Very important meeting."

"You must be emperor Karl Gearworth," he said.

"Fall."

"Maiden," Ozpin responded to the codeword.

He could see the couples scanning the environment around them, tension high.

"Come in this soundproof room."

Ozpin walked in slowly.

"Do you know who has the silver eyes?" the empress said.

"Ruby Rose," Ozpin answered.

"Then you are who you are," Karl said. "Or to the extent that I can confirm it. I made sure to check with your office to see if you are gone. There are mind tricksters in this world, after all. How did you find who sent the message?"

"I lived for a really long time. I knew all the ways one could obfuscate the origin of the sender, and all the ways to trace it," Ozpin answered.
