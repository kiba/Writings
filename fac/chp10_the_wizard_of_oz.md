# Chapter Ten: The Wizard of Oz

"Dawnson Peacefully Annexed!"

"The Space Exploration Treaty Organization is Formed."

"Native OS developed by Mechatron Released For Free."

"Trade Complaints Lodged Against Mechatron."

Ozpin scrolled down the headlines related to the new kingdom. There was nothing in his myths and legend that would had foretold its arrival.

Mysteriously, he received an anonymous letter from them. He knew that, for all the precaution that the imperial couple took, their operational security was imperfect. This mistake allowed him to capitalize on this error and find the source.

Under the guise of possibly establishing a new huntsmen academy, he arranged a meeting with them at their capital, Allothmy.

He took a look at his scroll, watching the time. They were already thirty minutes late. The headmaster can hear the heated discussion coming from the room, though the sounds are muffled. So Ozpin patiently waited.

Finally, the door to the imperial office disgorged power armor that was very common to Mechatron, and nowhere else.

"Ah, welcome," a male voice said as Ozpin entered the room. "I am very sorry for that. Very important meeting."

"You must be emperor Karl Gearworth," he said, sampling the names on his lip. By tradition, the names of a person was supposed to invoke a color, but Mechatron and their rulers really didn't hitch to present day traditions. They were supposedly survivor from an age long past, even before his knowledge of myths and legends.

"You want to discuss establishing an academy, yes?"

"And a letter among other things." The tension in the room went up at that mention. "You should soundproof your office. I heard voices through the wall."

"I heard that every kingdom has a huntsman academy," the female empress said.
