# Chapter Ten: The Wizard of Oz

"Dawnson Peacefully Annexed!"

"The Space Exploration Treaty Organization is Formed."

"Native OS developed by Mechatron Released For Free."

"Trade Complaints Lodged Against Mechatron."

Ozpin scrolled down the headlines related to the new kingdom. There was nothing in his myths and legend that would had foretold its arrival.

Mysteriously, he received an anonymous letter from them. He knew that, for all the precaution that the imperial couple took, their operational security was imperfect. This mistake allowed him to capitalize on this error and find the source.

Under the guise of possibly establishing a new huntsmen academy, he arranged a meeting with them at their capital, Allothmy.

He took a look at his scroll, watching the time. They were already thirty minutes late. The headmaster can hear the heated discussion coming from the room, though the sounds are muffled. So Ozpin patiently waited.

Finally, the door to the imperial office disgorged power armor that was very common to Mechatron, and nowhere else.

"Ah, welcome," a male voice said as Ozpin entered the room. "I am very sorry for that. Very important meeting."

"You must be emperor Karl Gearworth," he said, sampling the names on his lip. By tradition, the names of a person was supposed to invoke a color, but Mechatron and their rulers really didn't hitch to present day traditions. They were supposedly survivor from an age long past, even before his knowledge of myths and legends.

"You want to discuss establishing an academy, yes?"

"And a letter among other things." The tension in the room went up at that mention. "You should soundproof your office. I heard voices through the wall."

"I heard that every kingdom has a huntsman academy," the empress said. "But what is in it for us?"

"A good question. While huntsmen have global citizenship, they typically have a city that they usually return to constantly over time, and that city tended to be where the huntsman academy that they attend."

"A kingdom is synonymous with a city, yes?" the emperor asked.

"It is true that you only have two towns, but they are quickly becoming small cities; a micro kingdom. Assuming that your cities survived the growing Grimm threat, they should be able to host a small combat school until you can host a post-secondary huntsman academy. It is crucial that your academy is staffed by qualified professors. I can assist you in that, along with other headmasters."

"Well, what do you think, hon?"

"I think we could make the huntsmen academy part of the Allothmy university?" she wondered.

"That would be most unusual. While a huntsman academy teaches do post-secondary subjects, much of our focus is teaching students on combat and survival."

"Including learning how to make their own weapons?" Gearworth asked.

"Yes."

"I doubt it's prac-" Gearworth said before being muffled by the empress's hand.

"We are planning on one big university anyway," the empress said. "I believe you said something about a letter?"

The relaxed face of the two sovereigns became very serious in one moment.
