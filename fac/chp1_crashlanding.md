No idea where I am going to go with this...

Dear Engineer,

Your goal is to survive and start a civilization.

Sincerely, ROB.

Shit! Frak! Fuck! Jesus!

No amount of curses will change a thing.

Everything around me vibrated like crazy, and I couldn't see shit outside of my spacecraft. There was no windows to see outside of, because that would be a structural weakness. Instead, there were cameras mounted on the outside. But that didn't help either.

There were no signals from the cameras, and the sensor reading are nonsensical.

I didn't know the frak what was going on.

In spite of all that, I was frantically smashing buttons, looking for anything that could help.

Then, the number started making sense.

I knew I was losing altitude fast, because usually what happened when you're deorbiting. Turning to the other sensor gauge, I knew that I was oriented correctly. My senses told me that I was upside down, yet I knew trusting myself over the sensors at this point would be fatal.

Putting faith in my training, I followed the checklist that showed up on my screen, deviating only when it made scene. I switched on all sort of buttons and started the engine.

"Come on, come on," I said to myself, orienting the craft for a possible landing.

But alas, I didn't have enough time to make a smoother landing. The altitude dropped all the way to zero before I can adjust further.

Thunk!

I was jolted upward by the impact of the trees against the craft.

Thunk! Thu-thu-thu-thunk!

Then there was one mighty thud as the spacecraft hit the ground, sliding against the earth, before grinding to a stop.

At that moment, I knew that I am stranded on this planet.
