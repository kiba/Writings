# Chapter Eleven: Expansion

**Year 2, Day 27**

Lot of things happened all at once.

Dawn finally gave up remaining independent, choosing to become part of Mechatron. At this time, Allothmy grew to forty thousand, while Dawn is twice than that of my capital. We seemed to have hit a plateau yet. That's OK, because I need time for my cities to catch up on social services anyway.

The four kingdoms signed a treaty with me to form the SETO Or Space Exploration Treaty Organization.

We share rocket designs and manufacturing techniques. I realized that much of my logistics and production advantage will dissipate, but I am betting on having a more functional city than them, and I know that Remnant needs the technologies that it can get.

In that treaty was also an agreement to not use space for warfare. It's an unfortunate clause, but I also snuck in a subclause that authorized SETO to build a space military to defend against threats external to Remnant.

The treaty mollified the Kingdoms, and I can get back to doing what I like instead of what I hate.

We decided to release the Factorio OS to the world. They never heard of 'open source software' before. It's a very foreign thought to them.

Hosted a meeting with the Wizard of Oz. Explained to him everything I knew about RWBY, and took him to the grave of his ancestors.

With the secrets told, it's up to him to make this work.

**Year, Day 35**

Did a bunch of things with Dawn. Mostly, I built a railway to Dawn and started to practically rebuild Dawn. I also have much better to Dust now. I ordered my TBM and mining equipment to go there and start digging.

Did I mentioned I have ministers for quite a while now? A lie detection program allowed me to select honest ministers with the right experience so I don't have to work so hard doing background check and clever interview, not that I think it would do us any good.

Neither Rin and I knew anything about governing a country, so we delegated as much as we can get away with.

I expanded my welfare program to include universal healthcare, funded on the back of only one tax: the economist recommended but almost universally ignored land-value tax. It's a good thing that with guaranteed housing and power armor, some of our doctors are actually willing to work for peanuts.

Our population finally stopped exploding as well, which was a relief, because I need to keep ahead by burning dusts in generators(more wind dusts, please!) and building more solar panels. Factorio solar panels are really good, and so are their batteries. The solar panels are sixty percent efficient in converting sunlight to electricity. That's a crazy number back home.

**Year 2, Day 44**

A Schnee Dust Company representative approached us to sell their mine in Dawn.

I told them to shove it.

**Year 2, Day 46**

The data are in. My economist told me that real estate prices in Allothmy are actually stable, taking into account my planned expansion of space.

I am so glad that I can just implement an economist's proposal without having to deal with the fucking political class.

There's international politics, which was a nightmare.

**Year 2, Day 56**

Whittle is fucking amazing. He resolved all fourteen launch failures, right under the nose of SETO, and slipped it through peer review, and now it's in the blueprint.

**Year 2, Day 61**

My girlfriend?wife?co-ruler and I decided on a rotation schedule. We would each take turn in ruling the country, and doing our engineering and science pursuits.

**Year 2, Day 69**

Rin reminded me that the Vytal Festival is coming up and she wanted to see it in person.

I told her in no uncertain term: "No fucking way."

It turned into a big fight before we stopped talking to each other the whole day, even through dinner.

**Year 2, Day 73**

We chaired the first SETO conference on rocket designs. We noticed that seventy-five percent of them didn't like Whittle, while only a quarter were positive.

I knew Whittle pissed off his fellow collaborators something fierce.

Anyway, the conference spiraled into a three hours argument about the best way to approach rocket development.

Rin came up with a compromise. The engineers will vote for the top three rocket designs through preferential voting via a blind ballot. Then they would be divided up into three teams and have nine months to come up with a winning design.

At the end of the day, three designs were finally chosen. Whittle's design didn't win, so he grudgingly joined the design team with the proposal most similar to his. I believed his team will beat everybody else.

On our existing rocket: it's reliable enough that we're launching them everyday until failure. Whenever it failed, engineers get together to perform a root cause analysis so that it will be more reliable.

**Year 2, Day 79**

The city of Vale extended an invitation to us for the Vytal festival. Rin accepted. I grumbled.

**Year 2, Day 84**

The Schnee Dust Company closed down its mine in Dawn and sold it to us, citing fierce competition from the kingdom of Mechatron.

They also filed a lawsuit through all the kingdoms against us.

Screw them.

Despite the lawsuit, we decided not to disbar Schnee products from moving through our kingdom.

**Year 2, Day 90**

Phew, it's already been three months.

Anyway, we built up a substantial constellation of satellites, and we started selling graphene based general purpose computers to the kingdoms, which is superior to their silicon based tech.

Before that, we were already selling power armor suits
