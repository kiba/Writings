# Chapter Eleven: Expansion

**Year 2, Day 27**

Lot of things happened all at once.

Dawn finally gave up remaining independent, choosing to become part of Mechatron. At this time, Allothmy grew to forty thousand, while Dawn is twice than that of my capital. We seemed to have hit a plateau yet. That's OK, because I need time for my cities to catch up on social services anyway.

The four kingdoms signed a treaty with me to form the SETO Or Space Exploration Treaty Organization.

We share rocket designs and manufacturing techniques. I realized that much of my logistics and production advantage will dissipate, but I am betting on having a more functional city than them, and I know that Remnant needs the technologies that it can get.

In that treaty was also an agreement to not use space for warfare. It's an unfortunate clause, but I also snuck in a subclause that authorized SETO to build a space military to defend against threats external to Remnant.

The treaty mollified the Kingdoms, and I can get back to doing what I like instead of what I hate.

We decided to release the Factorio OS to the world. They never heard of 'open source software' before. It's a very foreign thought to them.

Hosted a meeting with the Wizard of Oz. Explained to him everything I knew about RWBY, and took him to the grave of his ancestors.

With the secrets told, it's up to him to make this work.

**Year, Day 35**

Did a bunch of things with Dawn. Mostly, I built a railway to Dawn and started to practically rebuild Dawn. I also have much better to Dust now. I ordered my TBM and mining equipment to go there and start digging.

Did I mentioned I have ministers now? Lie detection program allowed me to select honest ministers with the right experience so I don't have to work so hard doing background check and clever interview.

Frankly, neither Rin and I knew anything about governing a country. So we delegated as much as we can get away with.

Anyway, I expanded my welfare program to include universal healthcare, funded on the back of only one tax: the economist recommended but almost universally ignored land-value tax.
