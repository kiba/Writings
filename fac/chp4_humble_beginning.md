# Chapter Four: Humble Beginning

**Entry One**

It's different from playing the game for sure, because I am not staring overhead at a map. To fix that, I build a drone out of spare parts out of the nanofab so that I can have a overhead vision of my environment.

Now it's just like factorio, sort of.

Unlike the game where I have to unlock technology in weird lab modules, I can just browse it through the list of tech I can build. Unfortunately, I am limited by 'vitamins' rather than research, because I simply don't have enough materials. So I have to choose wisely.

Next to the drone, I chose to build a turret first before doing anything else, which was uncomplicated for the nanofab.

Unfortunately, it took an hour to build.

**Entry Two**

Andy: Hey, when we are going to land?

Engineer: Whenever I get enough fuels to get up there and fuel you.

Andy: How long is that?

Engineer: I don't know.

Andy: What are we supposed to do up there?

Engineer: Don't touch anything you don't know about. If you want to be useful, go through the auto-tutor and learn how to take care of the ship.

Andy: I thought we are paying for you to fix our ship?

Engineer: You paid the company to take you there. I was supposed to help setup the mining facility and then leave. But somebody somehow fucked up the coordinates intentionally.

Andy: Hehe...

Engineer: Anyway, the company's a cheap bastard. They set up the bare minimum needed for survival to beef up their margin, dropped training standard for customers, and now we're fucked.

Andy: What!!?

Engineer: What are you expecting when you get no training whatsoever, and everything is easy peasy when you get support through the intra-dimensional network? Now I have to dig ourselves out of this mess, and we don't know where the fuck we are on the dimensional map. We'll probably never get back. I shouldn't had taken this job.

Andy: WHAT IS THIS! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!

Engineer: Stop yelling at the only competent person trying to save your ass.

Andy: !@##$R scammer! I want my fucking money back!

**Entry Three**

Andy started a temper tantrum after hearing my assessment on the corporation that he hired. Suffice to say, I shut him off, hope that he doesn't blow up the ship, and get back to work.

It was Andy's fault that got us here, but moreover it was the company's fault for such lax training and poor selection of customers, and insufficient provision.
