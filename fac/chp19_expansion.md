# Chapter Nineteen: Expansion

**Year 2, 305**

The wedding was over five days ago. Everything went smoothly as it should. No White Fang attack, and even with the larger Grimm presence, my military handled everything.

My spy network was able to gather a lot of intel from inside the ballroom. Everybody probably knows that they were being spied on, but we were able to hear a lot of candid details.

Ironwood didn't think much of me. He thinks I am dangerous.

Hey! I have absolutely no intention of waging war against anybody.

**Year 2, 314**

We're prepping for a breakout after a long period of expanding our industrial capacity and getting the logistics ready. I want to expand both west and east to connect up with Vacuo and Vale.

**Year 2, 315**

The army's on the move.

**Year 2, 330**

We finally finished laying down a foundation which went all the way through the underground, and to the bedrock, we started building a skyscrapper. It shall be the tallest building in all of Remnant and will support all our residential needs for years to come. Not that it will stay that way long. Many of the residential apartment will quickly turn into businesses, which will in turn pays land value taxes.

Construction should be done in about sixty days, and it will tower a kilometer into the air. There will be ports for airships and freight elevators to bring the goodies down. Thanks to dimensional storage, the freight capacity is larger than expected, even though it isn't the primary channel for trade.

**Year 2, 332**

My spymaster said that she needed to meet with Jirayia to let him know that her team is not dead if rather unavailable.

**Year 2, 356**

I didn't want to get her killed, so I ordered a few huntsmen to go with her. Despite her protestation, the ninjas was ordered to wear hardsuits and her modern ninja gears.

**Year 2, 358**

Predictably, she came back with an offer by Jirayia to meet with the employing daimyo.

I said no, my empress said yes.

Eventually we came to an agreement to meet with Jirayia over a remote platform.

**Year 3, Day 2**

The spymaster insisted that her entire team will be there.

The empress and I argued with the spymaster in taking children. Ultimately, we relented as it was not a combat mission.

**Year 3, Day 4**

We met in a small town in a safehouse.

Jiraiya wasn't happy that he won't be taken to our land, even though it's not in the elemental nation.

The ninja made a dire threat about upsetting his applecart. Basically we were warned not to plunge the elemental nations into strife nor would we act against Konohagakure's interests.

We basically reiterate our promise and our interests. We also threaten him back if he decided to attack us as well.

After mutual threatening, it became more cordial. We revealed a bit about ourselves, and he revealed a bit about himself, trying to find out more about each other, which amounted to...nothingness.

Eventually he suggested sending a representative of his to our kingdom. We said no.

After that, we were done. The spymaster elected to leave Jiraiya with pornography, pictures only, as a gift. Then she made bedroom eyes at Jiraiya, which was a huge surprise to us, and disgusted the hell out of her genin.

We knew that he was a big prevert and that he has many lovers, but we never think it would include the spymaster.

Anyway, when we came back, the commander has a brief talk with her, in which spymaster gushed all about Jiraiya the Gallant, but made it clear that her team was far more important than Jiraiya will ever be.

A ninja did try to track the spymaster and her genin down, but they were able to get away.

**Year 3, Day 7**
