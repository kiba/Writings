# Chapter Nineteen: Expansion

**Year 2, 305**

The wedding was over five days ago. Everything went smoothly as it should. No White Fang attack, no riot, no stampede, and even with the larger Grimm presence, my military handled everything.

My spy network was able to gather a lot of intel from inside the ballroom. Everybody probably knows that they were being spied on, but we were able to hear a lot of candid details, including some crude remarks about my wife and me.

Ironwood didn't think much of me. He actually thought I am dangerous.

Hey! I have absolutely no intention of waging war against anybody. What about the time I helped prevent the kingdom of Vale? Isn't that supposed to mean something to you?

**Year 2, 314**

We're prepping for a breakout after a long period of expanding our industrial capacity and getting the logistics ready. I want to expand both west and east to connect up with Vacuo and Vale.

**Year 2, 315**

The army's on the move.

**Year 2, 330**

We finally finished laying down a foundation which went all the way through the underground, and to the bedrock, we started building a skyscrapper. It shall be the tallest building in all of Remnant and will support all our residential needs for years to come. Not that it will stay that way long. Many of the residential apartment will quickly turn into businesses, which will in turn pays land value taxes.

Construction should be done in about sixty days, and it will tower a kilometer into the air. There will be ports for airships and freight elevators to bring the goodies down. Thanks to dimensional storage, the freight capacity is larger than expected, even though it isn't the primary channel for export and import.

**Year 2, 332**

My spymaster said that she needed to meet with Jiraiya to let him know that her team is not dead if rather unavailable.

**Year 2, 356**

I didn't want to get her killed, so I ordered a few huntsmen to go with her. Despite her protestation, the ninja was ordered to wear her typical hardsuit and modern ninja gears for the mission.

She henged everything away.

**Year 2, 358**

Predictably, she came back with an offer by Jiraiya to meet with the employing daimyo.

I said no, my empress said yes.

Eventually we came to an agreement to meet with Jiraiya over a remote platform.

**Year 3, Day 2**

The spymaster insisted that her entire team will be there.

The empress and I argued with the spymaster in taking children. Ultimately, we relented as it was not a combat mission.

**Year 3, Day 4**

We met in a small town in a safehouse.

Jiraiya wasn't happy that he won't be taken to our land, even though it's not in the elemental nation.

The ninja made a dire threat about upsetting his applecart. Basically we were warned not to plunge the elemental nations into strife nor would we act against Konohagakure's interests.

We reiterated our promises and our interests. We also threaten him back if he decided to attack us as well.

After mutual threatening, it became more cordial. We revealed a bit about ourselves, and he revealed a bit about himself, trying to find out more about each other, which amounted to...nothingness.

Eventually he suggested sending a representative of his to our kingdom. We said no.

After that, we were done. The spymaster elected to leave Jiraiya with pornography, pictures only, as a gift. Then she made bedroom eyes at Jiraiya, which was a huge surprise to us, and disgusted the hell out of her genin.

We knew that he was a big pervert and that he has many lovers, but we never think it would include the spymaster.

A ninja did try to track the spymaster and her genin down, but they were able to get away.

When they came back, the commander had a brief talk with her, in which spymaster gushed all about Jiraiya the Gallant and how good he was in bed, but made it clear that her team was far more important than Jiraiya will ever be.

**Year 3, Day 7**

Ah. The stasis pod. We didn't have to reverse engineer the technology, since we have the CAD files, the manuals, and several thousand pages of documentation. It still took a while for us to perfect the manufacturing chain.

Now we're finally selling stasis pod technologies to the public.

We fulfilled the orders for hospital first, then for everyone else. The specs sheet are out there so people can determine if they're willing to spend energy to keep objects from experience thermodynamic processes. I might have said it before, but I must make it clear that the stasis pod technology cannot stop entropy. At best, it only slows down, as the tech required energy to operate.

One percent of revenue collected will be diverted to the SWF.

**Year 3, Day 8**

You know what my tax agency said about tax evasion cases? Zero percent! ZERO! MUHAHAHAHH! Beat that! It's all land-value taxes anyway. With no deductions, it's also basically impossible to game.

**Year 3, Day 20**

Strikes are arising from every kingdom except mine. Unions are upset that I am costing them jobs.

Consequently, there are talks of tariff. I don't like higher tariff than I already do, damn it!

**Year 3, Day 44**

A White Fang terrorist attack on an airship inside my territory, which included some very dead and non-recoverable Mechatron citizens.

I am going to fucking make them regret that they ever live.

**Year 3, Day 46**

OK. I have two days to calm down. Here's how I am going to dismantle the White Fang.

It's not going to work if I simply bomb every training camp. I must destroy their base of support.

To do that, I need to reach Faunus everywhere, and I have a huge advantage in that department. Mechatron is a kingdom with the highest concentration of Faunus everywhere, and they are very likely to have families across the four kingdoms.

To do that, I need to increase immigration and tie to Faunus communities and enclaves.

**Year 3, Day 47**

Adam Taurus made his appearance in video, claiming responsibility for the attack. Then he has the gall to call my wife lot of nasty and unpleasant names, which I won't reproduce here.

FUCK YOU!

He told the Faunus to turn away from the kingdom, saying that it's all a trap and so on. Blah blah blah, typical propaganda.

**Year 3, Day 48**

You know what? I felt absolutely powerless. Even if we were to start tomorrow hunting down white fang members. It will take decades at most to reduce the White Fang to an absolutely powerless version of themselves.

**Year 3, Day 49**

My wife made a response.

She told her story about the Human Liberation Front and how the ancestors of humanity perished, comparing it to the Faunus terrorist group, then she pledged support for the Faunus community here, vowing to help Faunus right groups fight injustice worldwide.

It was a very good response. We didn't change how we did security, didn't ask law enforcement to start suspecting Faunus more, or change our law to allow indefinite detention and so on. But I did task my spymaster to start infiltrating potential white fang groups. I believe the key to victory is to destroy their brotherhood.

**Year 3, Day 51**

Fuck. Large Scale Grimm attack imminent on the western front.
