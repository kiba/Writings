# Chapter Twenty-seven: Dwarven Affair

It was sunny and hot on this world, and completely free of Grimm. Specialist Glen Black thought that was amazing, in spite of the insufferable heat. The hardsuit that he would normally wears spoiled him completely. It has a built-in air conditioning and cooling system, which not only keeps him comfortable at all time, but also enhance performance in battle.

Behind him was the rest of the caravan, with everyone dressed in primitive clothing and with basic weapons. Nobody was allowed their usual personal weapons or hardsuits, and almost everything they had were supposed to be a match with the local civilization, which wasn't very sophisticated.

Black never guessed that Mechatron would possess an alien device for traveling to other worlds. Then again, he would have never guessed that a kingdom would pop out of nowhere four years ago either, or that somebody managed to create a portal to another world using reality-bending dusts. It seemed that a lot of thing has changed in the last four years.

"I saw something," the Atlasian specialist said. "Walls. Tall for the local civilization here, very quaint." He was supposed to not take anything for granted, but he saw what passed for warfare around here.

"So that's the mountainhome," the leader of the expedition said. "Supposed to be home to short little humans who may or may not require alcohol."

Black shrugged at the blondie. It was Major Blanc Sheppard who suggested the hairbrained mission. The RSC found a green lush world with no Grimm and no real threat. Yet, they're wasting time on missions like these. Who the fuck cared about the local politics?

"Black. You will be on your best behavior. You will say nothing and play it safe."

"Crystal clear, ma'am."

The dwarves weren't about to let any shitting donkeys, horses, mules, or any manure other generating creatures into their mountainhome. "Unclean," they explained.

Instead, the caravan was forced to pay a fee to have their goods transported to a warehouse by dwarven haulers, all on the famed dwarven honor.

Which was fine by the party. They have more gold where that came from. More gold than the dwarves could possibly imagine. They also weren't actual merchants and traders, just a scouting party. Making a profit isn't particularly relevant to their goal.

"The architecture...is amazing," a green haired anthropologist said. The scouting party descended down a ram into the fortress, having went past three set of walls, one higher than the other.

"You're crazy?" Black asked.

The Atlasian specialist been through Mechatron's gate before, which were well guarded by gatling turrets and other lethal measures. Somehow, the less technological advanced traps of spiked balls and giant stones hanging above them were as menacing to the specialist as well.

"Didn't you see the grand open hall? I wonder how they did it, without modern digging technologies."

"Did you see their defenses, woman? They can target or attack us from any direction they like, and several doors that attackers would need to get through. Defense in depth."

"I guess that's impressive too..."

"I am relying on you not to offend our hosts. Unlike the humans that we encountered thus far, the dwarves are not folks to mess with."

The dwarves stopped.

"What's going on?" the commander asked in the local tongue.

The dwarves who just had been pushing forward the carts explained to the party the need to load materials onto a set of wheeled platforms on grooved tracks; a railway system. They said that they're working on an above ground train station, but for now this will do.

Then the laborer started to push the cart into the platform and beckoned the party to ride the platform as well. From there, it was a quick ride to the trade warehouse.

***

The fortress seemed to be awfully a lot more sophisticated than the human kingdom that the group traveled through. It seemed that everything was organized systematically by a bureaucracy. There were no bribes, no room for bargaining, and standardized price for everything, even if there's the pervasive stink of alcohol.

Black was ready to believe that those dwarves are really a nation of alcoholics. Qrow would have loved this place.

A dwarf in a certain uniform showed up at the unloading dock, with a clipboard in hand. "Hi, I am Urist McTrader, and I will be your broker for the day. Where would like a stall?"

***

The party rented a stall somewhere between the prime location and the poorest for several days' gold, and unloaded the glassware onto the shelves. They had already sold glassware to customers across the kingdoms before arriving in the fortress, plenty of practice to screw up and learn what not to do. Thus, they already have good solid covers with lot of great lies about the origin of their glassware, unless the dwarves are actually more discerning and suspicious than the humans.

"Alright, everyone," the commander said once everyone gathered together. "You know your jobs and your mission. Let the anthropologists and social experts do the talking, the guards the guarding. Be discrete with your radio and storage seals. We don't want to look silly or suspicious to the locals. Remember your code."

If things was about to go to shit, there's hidden storage seals hidden in journals that store fast-deploy hardsuits.

***

Minori, the green hair lady, seemed content to roam around the city, doing nothing but looking around. Black was fine with that. The anthropologists were supposed to interface with different culture, but there's no guarantee that they won't make social impasse.

"I love those engraving! I wonder what they all mean?" She said. "Every inch of this place was either engraved or decorated or arranged. There seemed to be a purpose and organization. Do you think they have something like the Bureau of Public Art?"

"I don't know," Black replied. "What do I care?"

"Aren't you at the least curious?"

"I am more interested in getting out of this place alive."

A dwarf suddenly streaked naked down the street, foaming at the mouth, followed by several grim looking dwarves dressed in armor.

"What the fuck!?" Black exclaimed.
