# Chapter Twenty-seven: Dwarven Affair

It was a hot sunny day on this world, and completely free of Grimm. Specialist Glen Black thought the latter was amazing, even with the unbearable heat. The hardsuit that he would normally wear spoiled him completely. It has a built-in air conditioning and cooling system, which not only keeps him comfortable at all time, but also enhance performance in battle.

Behind him was the rest of the "caravan", with everyone dressed in primitive clothing and armed with only basic melee weapons, made of a very strong steel alloy superior to the locals'. Part of the mission parameter is to blend in, not attract everyone's attention everywhere they go.

Black never guessed that Mechatron would possess an alien device for traveling to other worlds. Then again, he would have never guessed that a kingdom would pop out of nowhere four years ago either, or that somebody managed to create a portal to another world using reality-bending dusts. It seemed that a lot of things has changed in the last four years.

"I saw something," the Atlasian specialist said. "Walls. Tall for the local civilization here, very quaint." He was supposed to not take anything for granted, but he saw what passed for warfare around here. Maybe the mountainhome are supposed to be a different level altogether, but he hoped they will be no match against him.

"So that's the mountainhome," the leader of the expedition said. "Supposed to be home to short little humans who may or may not require alcohol in order to live."

Black shrugged at the blondie. It was Major Blanc Sheppard who suggested the harebrained mission. The RSC found a green lush world with no Grimm and no real threat. Yet, they're wasting time on missions like these. Who the fuck cared about the local politics? It was high time to demolish the area surrounding the stargate and start building a colony.

"Black. You will be on your best behavior," his commander warned. "You will say nothing and play it safe."

"Crystal clear, ma'am," Glenn Black acknowledged.

***

The dwarves weren't about to let any shitting donkeys, horses, mules, or any other manure generating creatures into their mountainhome. "Unclean," they explained. "And we're tired of cleaning the shit inside the hallways of our home." Fair enough.

Instead, the caravan paid a fee to have their goods transported to a warehouse by dwarven haulers, all on the famed dwarven honor.

Black suspected that it was also about an excuse to make money, but the party didn't care, since they weren't actual merchants and traders, just a scouting party, even if their members were required to act the part.

"The architecture...is amazing," a green haired anthropologist said. The scouting party descended down a shallow ramp into the fortress. They had just went past three set of walls, one higher than the other, no doubt filled with all sort of defensive measures.

"You're crazy?" Black asked.

The Atlasian specialist been through Mechatron's gate before, which were well guarded by gatling turrets and other lethal measures. Somehow, the less technological advanced traps of spiked balls and giant stones hanging above them were just as menacing to the specialist.

"Didn't you see the grand open hall? I wonder how they did it, without modern digging technologies."

"Did you see their defenses, woman? They can target or attack us from any direction they like, and several heavy doors that attackers would need to get through. The only other way are the winding pathways that they constructed. Defense in depth."

"I guess that's impressive too..."

"I am relying on you not to offend our hosts. Unlike the humans that we encountered thus far, the dwarves are not folks we want to mess with."

The dwarves stopped.

"What's going on?" the commander asked in the local tongue.

The dwarves who just had been pushing forward the carts explained to the party the need to load materials onto a set of wheeled platforms on grooved tracks; a railway system. They said that they're working on an above ground train station, but for now this will do.

Then the laborer started to push the cart into the platform and beckoned the party to ride the platform as well. From there, it was a quick ride to the trade district.

***

The fortress seemed to be awfully a lot more sophisticated than the human kingdom that the group traveled through. The dwarves were courteous and efficient. There were no bribes, no room for bargaining, and standardized price for everything, even if there's the pervasive stink of alcohol.

Black was ready to believe that those dwarves are really a nation of alcoholics. Qrow would have loved this place.

A dwarf in a certain uniform showed up at the unloading dock, with a clipboard in hand. "Hi, I am Urist McTrader, and I will be your broker for the day. Where would you like a stall?"

***

The party rented a stall somewhere between the prime location and the poorest for several days' gold, and unloaded the glassware onto the shelves. Previous expedition had already sold glassware to customers to the locals before this missiont to the fortress. It's plenty of practice to screw up and learn what not to do. By now, two members on the team were already experienced in the art of lying the hell out to the locals about the origin of Remnan glassware. They'll be the one hawking those goods to the dwarves here.

Everyone gathered together once the unloading was finished.

"Alright, everyone," the commander said. "You know your jobs and your mission. Let the anthropologists and social experts do the talking, the guards the guarding. Be discrete with your radio and storage seals. We don't want to look silly or suspicious to the locals. Remember your code."

If things was about to go to shit, there's hidden storage seals hidden in journals that store fast-deploy hardsuits and radios.

***

Minori, the lady with the green hair, seemed content to roam around the city, not bothering to talk to the locals. Black was fine with that. The anthropologists were supposed to interface with different culture, but there's no guarantee that they won't make social impasse. It wasn't like they have a lot of experience with different cultures.

"I love those engraving! I wonder what they all mean?" She said. "Every inch of this place was either engraved or decorated or arranged. There seemed to be a coherent organization to the engraving. Do you think they have something like the Bureau of Public Art?"

"I don't know," Black replied. "What do I care?"

"Aren't you at the least curious?"

"I can be curious once we settle this world."

A dwarf suddenly streaked naked down the street, foaming at the mouth, chased by armored dwarves.

"What in the world?!" Black exclaimed.
