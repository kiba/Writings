A fanfic based on the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/).

# Chapter One: ROBbed

***
**Day 1**

How did I get here?

Last night I went to sleep, and now I am in the middle of a grassy plain with no one in sight. I noticed that I have been encased in a very comfortable and light suit. It wasn't just the suit of armor, either. My nose wasn't congested and my eyes apparently don't need glasses.

It didn't take me very long to notice the HUD.

***
**Day 2**

Fuck you ROB, all I get is shitty food made from faux-food made my nanofabricator. Can't I at least get a cheeseburger?

At least I don't have to worry about cleaning up shit ever again, thanks to my pocket dimension nanofabricator.

***
**Day 3**

I am in Factorio, or in a very close approximation of it, anyway. From accessing my message, I learned that I been ROBbed. A random omnipotent being had kidnapped me, or cloned me and put me in this setting.

I started out on Day One just following the tutorial. It was a very well made one if rather boring. I diligently followed the instruction so that I don't miss anything.

In just three days, I made a functional base, complete with belts, inserters, power plant assembly,
mining drills, smelters, turrets, and walls.

The interface was unsurprisingly very different from the computer game. I use a combination of gesture and voice command to do what I wanted. From there, building can materialize out of thin air, or disappear just as easy using clarktech bullshit magic. There's a limit to what I can place though. For example, if I try to place a mining drill on top of a rock, it will give me an error explaining exactly why. Very user friendly.

Where-as the game mechanic very much limit what I can manufacture based on what I research, there's no such things there. I have full access to the factorio catalog, including way more buildings and machines that I never thought I need, as well as the ability to create and modify machinery in a CAD program.

Alas, it also means that research cannot occur without any scientists. The description of the various labs required that I need somebody intelligence to manage them.

Given that I have absolutely no time to actually conduct research, my priority is logistics and production.

Lastly, I can pretty much craft anything given time and the right type of atoms. The suit carry a nanofabricator machine contained in a pocket dimension. It's a good thing that the suit came with all the necessary buildings to produce what I need to manufacture stuff to feed my nanofabricator.

Addendum: I just learned that there is a big fucking rocket in orbit. By big, I mean able-to-carry two hundred tons worth of mass, and that's without pocket dimensional technology. The only problem? I can't get to orbit.

**Day 4**

I built a drone to scout the surrounding environment. I found biter nests.

FUUUUCCCCK.

OK. What should I do? Don't panic. Think, think, think.

***
**Day 5**

You know what's bullshit? The ores. It's like somebody decided that everything you need on the periodic table should be placed in my starting area.

That's not actually true, but it's true enough that I can actually build a base that can produce something without requiring my nanofabricator.

***
**Day 6**

I got so sick of the food that my nanofabricator put out that I went and hunt down some alien meats.

I didn't die or anything like that.

***
**Day 7**

I started producing lot of walls and turrets without actually increasing production capacity, thus not increasing pollution.

This however, lead to resource starvation for my assemblers which is really annoying, but I can't do much about it.

Moreover, I been working on command and control. There's a lot more stuff in my production catalog to produce pretty much anything I need to build something else, but there's serious deficiencies in the catalog options. There are no autonomous ground combat platforms, none. Zip, zero, nada.

Thus, as part my first R&D task, I been working to develop several variations of the car, which I nicknamed Doom Buggy, and I am also working on the command and control.

***
**Day 15**

Did a remote test drive, accidentally ran a biter over. That's my first kill ever. Wow.

And it was just a C&C doom buggy.

***
**Day 45**

Fuck yeah. I got a platoon ready to fuck shit up. Composed of one C&C car, one drone car, and the rest regular old machine gunning cars that I remembered from playing factorio.

With luck, I should be able to control my units like a RTS game.

***
**Day 46**

This is way too easy. My doom buggies crushed a biter nest no problem.

***
**Day 47**

FUCK.

I just set off a major counter-reaction. It's not just the small biters, but its bigger brothers and sisters, including worms that spit nasty acid balls.

***
**Day 48**

Frak, my doom buggies got crushed because of terrible RTS controls. Need better control mechanism.

***
**Day 49**

Northwest side outer-defense walls got trashed, but the turrets stopped the biters from getting in any further.

I stored the specimen for later research, but there's basically no point without a researcher.

***
**Day 52**

HAHAHAHHAHA! I just sent out a squad of doom buggies, and they're effectively fucking things up.

DIE! DIE! DIE!

***
**Day 53**

Damn it. My doom buggies got crushed by big worm turrets. I should had seen it coming.

***
**Day 67**

I kept pressing the attack as soon as I regrown my fleet of doom buggies. I also included artillery to avoid a repeat with the room turrets.

As a result of that, most of the nests are gone, and I am free to expand my base. MUHAHAHAHHAHA.

Until I expand too much.

***
**Day 68**

I am fucking lonely.

***
**Day 79**

My scout drone found what looked like a weird version of stargate. I wasted no time in commanding Alpha Platoon to investigate the site.

***
**Day 80**

Yep, it's a fucking stargate. My HUD told me as much.

IWANTTOMEETPEOPLEBADLYPLEASEOHGOD!

***
**Day 90**

I laid tracks to the stargate, built a train, and started shipping turrets and walls, while my doom buggies guard the stargate.

I DID NOT WANT the biters to snatch it away!

Also, I finally accessed the stargate HUD.

However, there is only one address it will allowed me to access.

Remnant.

FUUUUUUUCCKKK YEEESSSS!

PEOOOOOOPLE!
