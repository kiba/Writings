# Chapter Twenty-six: Ninja and Terrorism

**Year 3, Day 323**

Sealing is bullshit. All you need is paper, ink, and a chakra user and you could do things that's out of reach for our technological base. On the other hand, sealing required a lot of research, and if you want to do something else, you'll have to literally draw something else different, not just altering the diagram there or here.

One of spymaster's student, Satoshi is really blossoming in his study. Studying physics and getting lot of ideas really do him wonder, or so they said.

Satoshi recently developed a CCTV equivalent of a seal, the first of its kind as far as Satoshi knew anywhere in the universe.

It's too bad that we can't make use of seals since we don't have a chakra system, but it's something to think about as we deepen our study of chakra biology. Someday, everyone will have bullshit ninja magic.

**Year 3, Day 325**

Every kingdom on Remnant is finally on board with the MSC, all sending special operators or huntsmen. As a result, the Mechatron Stargate Command is now renamed to Remnant Stargate Command.

**Year 3, Day 326**

Printing seals doesn't require much infrastructure, but we have no way to test for correctness, other than making sure that it is drawn precisely, until now.

Satoshi finished his work on checking seal correctness, using another seals, Admittedly, it has to be calibrated for each new type of seal.

Not that we need one, but it's nice that our seal printing factory got a little bit safer.

**Year 3, Day 330**

The kids petitioned to go back to the Elemental Nations for a six month period, during which they resume working with their merchant network, and improving people's live through dangerous ninja missions. It will allow us to silently uplift the Elemental Nation more easily.

They are all of age to start fighting again. Rin flatly said no, saying that children shouldn't have to fight. I thought about leaning toward 'yes'.

I need them to be loyal to me. If they aren't able to go back home and start improving things there...well...

**Year 3, Day 333**

A White Fang terrorist tried to bomb the local market. Bad idea. We caught his ass. Now he's going to get the finest defense lawyers while we throw the book at him.

**Year 3, Day 336**

The White Fang launched a series of bombing attacks against Mechatron affiliated organizations across Remnant.

All total, Remnant suffered fifteen people dead and hundred wounded. I am not pleased, but I also recognized that it's generating sympathy for Mechatron, and causing Faunus everywhere to be less supportive of the White Fang. Terrorists aren't exactly the brightest people in the world.

**Year 3, Day 338**

Simultaneous protests and marches are showing across the globe in Faunus communities against the White Fang.

It is a PR disaster for the White Fang.

**Year 3, Day 339**

We got news that Summer Rose came forward. It should be interesting.

**Year 3, Day 340**

My wife finally succumbed to the kids. The teenagers are going starting next year, but they're going with two experienced huntsman. It will be six months long before they'll return.

**Year 3, Day 344**

One of our informant got inside a White Fang base.

He needed to be extracted as soon as possible.

**Year 3, Day 345**

What a fucking mess. They killed him before we got there.

A lot of White Fang mooks died to our robots before they got into contact with special ops. Some did surrender. We found a whole bunch of intel on the White Fang.

It's still considered a failure, because an asset of our died. We'll have to compensate his family for their loss.

**Year 3, Day 350**

Summer Rose reunited with her family.

**Year 3, Day 355**

A rocket design got canceled, leaving us with only two rocket launches.

**Year 3, Day 360**

We capped the end of the year with a rocket launch for a dust-mixed methane rocket.

**Year 4, Day 3**

Controversy ensued over on whether or not Summer Rose will be allowed to keep her American citizenship.

I am not a lawyer, but I doubt Summer Rose will be allowed to keep her citizenship. The POTUS is supportive, but many republicans are on the other side.

May Rose isn't in danger of losing citizenship since she was born on American soil.

**Year 4, Day 7**

We launched a space station into orbit. The cadence for our dust-based rocket got tighter.

It got the attention of a certain aerospace company in California.

**Year 4, Day 14**

The ninja kids are prepped. The spymaster, who's the leader of her team is staying behind. She's confident in the two huntsmen assigned to the kids, having fought them in spares constantly.

**Year 4, Day 15**

The ninja departed.

**Year 4, Day 17**

Before Mechatron showed up on the scene, Remnant would be roughly equal technologically to Earth. Now we're outclassing them.

However, Earth has key advantages in certain area, such as the internet and jet engines. We still haven't built a supersonic jet yet.

Currently, we're trading dusts away for sample of their technology, if inferior.

I heard we're on the verge of negotiating an actual trade agreement with the Earthlings.

Personally? I want better camera and more researchers.

**Year 4, Day 19**

We're starting to merge software development of our operating system with the linux kernel project. The bandwidth to support internet traffic is increasing day by day, as more fiber optics are hooked up to the CCTS and satellites.

**Year 4, Day 25**

YES! The RSC discovered a new lush world!

We spotted medieval style villages and towns from our ballon that we launched.

We are not sure how dangerous the world will be, yet.

But if it's considered safe, it may be a new colonization site for the whole of Remnant. Wouldn't that be something? This is a place that Salem won't be able to touch, until we clean her clock out.

**Year 4, Day 26**

OK, the explorers reported that the local humans on the new planet are filthy and they smell. At least they have a sewer system, even if that is necessarily polluting the water downstream.

**Year 4, Day 28**

Wifey reminded me that the Vytal Festival is coming, and that we'll be the one hosting it.

Fuck.

**Year 4, Day 29**

Ok, there's rumors of dwarves and their mountainhome.

Does that remind me of something?

**Year 4, Day 31**

A news team from the United States arrived in Atlas, and they wanted to know more about the world of Remnant.

**Year 4, Day 37**

We sent a team disguised as traders to a mountainhome thirty kilometers from here.

**Year 4, Day 44**

Another team of Earthlings arrived in our capital. They wanted an interview with me. They're going to get one.
