# Chapter Twenty-five: Interlude: Mechatron Machines

This list is not a comprehensive overview of Mechatron machines, units, technology, and equipment.

## **Category: Warfare**

* **Doom Buggy** - The first autonomous ground unit, developed using the original "car" blueprint, adding a much needed element to the Mechatron arsenal. Otherwise, it is impossible for Mechatron to contest territory beyond its core territory. The original autonomous blueprint was a hacked together prototype that works well enough. Since then, much of the space intended for humans was removed and the buggy was instead packed with everything else, cumulating in the MK Three, which is capable of packing shield, standard sensor package, scouting drone, and a weapon loadout.

* **Shiftcycle** - The first transforming autonomous ground unit that can transform from a motorcycle into a four legged body plan. It was almost canned by the ruling royal for being too complicated, unreliable, and too difficult to maintain and manufacture. The machine's mobility on the battlefield allowed Mechatron to contest area where previously only legged infantry could, as well as being speedy as wheeled units when necessary. This is in spite of the flaws that the royals thought as a weakness to its design. The design opened the way for more transforming Mechatron designs.

* **Light Infantry Bot** or **LIB** - Adapted from exoskeleton designs, it proved to be the workhorse of ground units, taking the role of human infantry in seizing and controlling territory as well operate interfaces designed for humans.

* **Heavy Infantry Bot** or **HIB** - Twice the mass of LIB, this design trades for heavier firepower at the expense of mobility and speed.

* **SpritFire class Airship** - The first design for a long range airship to provide expeditionary capability.

## **Category: Construction and Logistics**

* **Logistic drone** - The main logistical workhorse of Mechatron. Its purpose is to carry materials and items from one location or another. Citizens in the kingdom of Mechatron can purchase services directly from the logistic network. The fee either went to maintenance or to the Mechatron's Sovereign Wealth Fund.

* **Construction drone** -

## **Category: Equipment**

* **Dimensional Storage** -  In essence, a device that can generate a pocket dimension and store items within it.  Curiously, it cannot store organic living beings. There are various failsafe built into it should the device maintaining the pocket dimension be destroyed.

* **Stasis pod** - A technology scavenged from the ruins of Allothmy. Supplied with the necessary energy, a stasis pod can generate a field to stop the thermodynamic process of an object from proceeding, effectively preserving it. Unsurprisingly, it had first found uses in the medical industry, especially in hospital, to store a person away until he or she can be care for by medical professional.
