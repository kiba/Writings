# Chapter Five: Evolution

***
**Entry Thirteen**

Oh god. Half of my base got wrecked by the biters, the other half are either malfunctioning or offline. My turrets held out, but the walls are almost half useless.

Seventy-five percent of my drone workforce got destroyed. This is catastrophic.

It's a good thing that I fortified the landing where the space shuttle used to be. It's also where I keep my laboratory as well. Need more military stuff.

**Entry Fourteen**

The alien research finally yielded something useful for me.

The alien blood can refined into useful alien crystals. Those crystals can be fed directly into the nanofab to make stuff faster and with more efficiency. Don't ask me how it all work, but that is what the research assistant figured out. This is awesome! That's why I been collecting alien corpses, even though they cogged up my inventory like mad.

All my turrets are now loaded with better target definitions. They will now kill biters with more efficiency.

Also, since the biters destroyed my base, pollution been way down. I been using that to fab more turrets and fortify walls like mad, neglecting my production capacity. It's a balance.

Finally, I need to capture a real live alien and expand my lab to include a bestiary. Jesus.

***
**Entry Fifteen**

I finally replicated a full nanofab. Now I actually have a backup. Hip hip hooray! Too bad it took me a full week. A full week of producing nothing else.

The original nanofab is now working to reproduce itself. The new copy is working to rebuild the base.

I also got really good at repairing drones.

***
**Entry Sixteen**

Base finally back to normal. Production up, pollution up, biter agitations as well.

Also, a biter captured for my bestiary! The research assistant is now shocking, prodding, and poking them to death. Brilliant!

I set up a parallel research assistant to work on a separate project. I need to reduce my material requirement.

***
**Entry Seventeen**

Holy @#$! The biters got a burrower!

It was an easy kill roughly, but now there's a GIANT GAPPING HOLE IN MY DEFENSE.

***
**Entry Eighteen**

Filled in the gapping hole with concrete. Now, I am working to extend the wall underground as much as possible.

I also took advantage of the tunnel dug by the biters to expand underground. There's lot of rich veins to exploit.

***
**Entry Nineteen**

RA(research assistant) #1 finished its research on the biters, unlocking a whole new tech tree for the biters.

RA #2 reduced the steel requirement of turrets by one percent.

I also started producing steel ball bearings rather than just making raw steels and other blank metals for my nanofabber to use.

I have four of them now. Two of which is dedicated to producing more copies of itself. But oh boy is it energy intensive, even with alien goos. There's a reason why you're supposed to build specialized machinery for making stuff.

***
**Entry Twenty**

OK, I really need to wipe out the alien nests. I love alien goos as the next guy, bug they are a THREAT to my base and my existence.

Pollution level is higher than it ever been. I begun propping down air filter, but this is a drain on my energy use. I have a nuclear fusion reactor, but it isn't exactly unlimited.

I also realized that such a reactor cannot be replicated fast enough. The lead time for a fusion reactor is like ten years or something on the nanofab.

So I begun plastering EVERYWHERE with solar panels.

**Entry Twenty-one**

Engineer: So you hadn't been bothering with me lately.

Andy: I realized that I have to take responsibility for my wife and my children. Screaming at someone who's trying to help you isn't going to help anybody.

Engineer: Uh-huh.

Andy: And I stranded everyone here.

Engineer: I knew that. I also know that it won't do any good, because we will never be getting back to known space, ever.

Andy: I missed my mom...

Engineer: Sucks to be you then. Just keep doing the auto-tutor. You need to maintain the spacecraft until I can get up there. Remember, I am checking your progress everday.

***
**Entry Twenty-two**

Phew, all pollutions are now piped to an air filtration facility. Seriously, I don't like the idea of using so much resources, but I really don't want to deal with the biters.

I finally finished building my first dune buggy death squad. I also built a RTS control program for it too.

***
**Entry Twenty-three**

Eighty percent casualty rate. Eighty-percent of the dune buggies failed to make it back alive all just for wiping out a few nests. Unacceptable losses.

I also didn't gather any of the alien corpses. I should had modified a dune buggy for carrying a pocket container. Those are so nifty.


***
**Entry Twenty-four**

I am making all the necessary steel components, from nails, steel beams, ball bearings, to pipes, and ammoboxes. Hell yeah!

My factory is also starting to produce all kind of necessary intermediate products now. It was hard figuring out conveyor belts in a 3D world though. All those crisscrossing conveyors is giving me a huge headache.

***
**Entry Twenty-five**

Did I forgot to mention how much of a pain it is to balance production?

I built another research assistant to manage my factory.

Nothing can possibility go wrong, right?

It will probably end in my death, being converted to make more computers. But the alternate is that I'll end up death, being ripped to pieces by biters.

There's also tons of fail-safe built into the AIs and it's not like that it can get super-smart like so many AI enthusiasts fear.

It doesn't make sense to me, but whatever.

***
**Entry Twenty-six**

I now have a platoon of killer doom buggies. Yeah! I already sent them out raiding an alien base with close to zero casualties.

Maybe I should install another research assistant.

***
**Entry Twenty-seven**

I did it. I installed a research assistant AI with the necessary modification to direct military defense and control doom buggies.

I DOOMED US ALL.
