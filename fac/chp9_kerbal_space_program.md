# Chapter Nine: Kerbal Space Program

**Day 316**

Phew! Sorry, for not writing in my journal. I been so incredibly busy with building a new kingdom. It was also a fucking headache. Should had quit the first chance we got.

But nooooooo! Rin wanted to play empress, and I got in my big head I could play as an emperor as well. Always wanted to start my own empire.

Look where it got us.

We got three thousand people in Allothmy. That's a drop in the bucket when you consider that five hundred million lives on Remnant. A far cry from seven billion on my home planet, but still mega-huge.

Dawnson still hadn't decided whether to become part of my kingdom, but they're a protectorate by the virtue of being very close. It's even bigger now, with over ten thousand people living there. They're doing brisk trade trading with us and the rest of the world.

Free apartment and power armor suit, and rationing are apparently not enough.

At least it isn't exploding in population size. That would be a huge mess. On the other hand, we're still desperately searching for skillsets. We need more people!

The other kingdoms hadn't decide to screw us over with an arms limitation treaty. Instead, they very much liked the idea of sharing tech.

They're going to be so disappointed with my military robots. It's not really advanced. The real jewel is the logistics and production system, which I am not going to give away so easily.

**Day 320**

I haven't taken a look at my factory in the biter world in a long time, other than to fix things. I should really send over some factory managers.
