# Chapter Nine: Kerbal Space Program

**Day 316**

Phew! Sorry, for not writing in my journal for a while. I been so incredibly busy with building a new kingdom. It was also a fucking headache. Should had quit the first chance we got.

But nooooooo! Rin wanted to play empress, and I got in my big head I should play as the emperor as well. Always wanted to start my own empire.

Look where it got us.

We got three thousand people in Allothmy. That's a drop in the bucket when you consider that five hundred million humans live on Remnant. A far cry from seven billion on my home planet, but still mega-huge.

Dawnson still hadn't decided whether to become part of my kingdom, but they're a protectorate by the virtue of being very close. It's even bigger now, with over ten thousand people living there. They're doing brisk trade trading with us and the rest of the world.

Free apartment and power armor suit, and rationing are apparently not enough.

At least it isn't exploding in population size. That would be a huge mess. On the other hand, we're still desperately searching for skillsets. We need more people!

The other kingdoms hadn't decide to screw us over with an arms limitation treaty. Instead, they very much liked the idea of sharing tech.

They're going to be so disappointed with my military robots. It's not really advanced. The real jewel is the logistics and production system, which I am not going to give away so easily.

**Day 320**

The factory in the biter world wasn't well optimized. The only thing I did was to make sure they're running smoothly. Really, humans are the only reason why I am not crashing my factory on biter planet hard. I should really send over some workers, but it's hidden from the public for a reason, and I am not ready to trust workers with state secrets just yet.

However, given that the workers are managing the other half, my workload became considerably easier. So I shifted some production capacity over to Remnant to free up the biter factory even more, reducing my footprint in this world.

I am ready to start a rocket factory.

**Day 327**

The rocket spec is pretty damn pitiful. It can only carry one eight hundred kilogram to LEO(Low Earth Orbit), and is certainly not reusable. Hell, the launchpad is basically a nuclear missile silo.

However, the industrial requirement is actually not that large, unlike in the game Factorio.

The difficulty comes with coping with extremely tight tolerance and extreme conditions. The engineering and quality assurance are much more important than being able to mass-produce rockets.

I knew that most of my machines aren't really that high tech to begin with.

**Day 331**

Been deploying EHC(Environmental Hazard Cleaner) tech around the base as developed by omni-engineer Rin Furukawa! I actually forgot this at once point, but Rin was steadfast in working on projects, even if it took forever. She'll finish what she started.

Somewhat expensive to make, but the factory environment is cleaner than ever before.

**Day 333**

I am considering whether to port the linux based Factorio Operating System to Remnant computer devices, given that my own graphene computers are much faster than their.

**Day 338**

Built a satellite and loaded the satellite into the rocket.

Watched the launch with my girlfriend. It didn't experience a RUD(Rapid unplanned assembly) event.

**Day 340**

Satellite looking good so far. I can see the ground now!

Except, there's biters everywhere! Some with different morphology than I had encountered so far. Oh god.

At least there's rich ores to mine on the ground.

**Day 344**

Launched another. Working on a satellite constellation for GPS.

**Day 347**

Dammmmnnnnnn it! The rocket blew up!

Rin said she can be a rocket scientist but she also got a ton of other projects on her plate.

**Day 348**

Frank Whittle wanted to work with us.

Apparently, he was rejected by Vale on his grant proposal to fund his supersonic jet engine project. Even Atlas was short-sighed. "We don't need it," they said. "Our jets are plenty fast enough to fight monsters."

Their loss is my gain! I don't need him to build supersonic jets either. I want him to build rockets. He's just as happy to work on that.

You know the other grant proposal. It goes like this:

"Frank Whittle, everyone knows that getting a rocket to work in space is impossible."

"No, damn it! I am not using Dust fuels!"

One of the other project should be to discover why dust only works in the atmosphere.

**Day 349**

Oh dear, Whittle broke into tears about Earth and how ashamed he was to forgot English. His real name isn't actually Frank Whittle.

You know the pioneer of jet engines? He named himself after the British airman because he didn't know his real name.

I found an Earthling, guys!

The man explained his backstory as an aviator who was found wrecked to shit by a huntress chick. That woman is married to him.

Twice as good! I got a dedicated aeronautic engineer, and a resident huntress. Did you know that Rin Furukawa signed a treaty with the kingdoms a while ago, granting global citizenship for huntsmen? I thought it was nuts giving away our sovereignity like that. Next thing you know, they wanted a global government!

Actually, I don't think it's an inherently a bad idea.

I could actually stop being an emperor and start being an engineer again. That would be nice.

**Day 355**

Doctor Whittle grumbled about needing more engineers, not just aeronautical, but also electrical, mechanical, etc.

I know I need more engineers, Jesus.

**Day 356**

Finally sent a secret letter to Professor Ozpin about the original timeline. I hoped it won't be discovered nafarious forces.

**Day 359**

Rin and I celebrated what passed for Christmas here. It actually isn't Christmas.

**Year 2, Day 1**

A new year on Remnant, coincidentally. I also celebrated one year of being stranded in the multiverse.

**Year 2, Day 3**

Doctor Whittle finally found the root cause of accident number one and is working with Rin to implement the bugfix.

Now he has to identify fourteen other accidents! It's a good thing that I saved ALL the debris that I can identify, and all the telemetries I can muster.

**Year 2, Day 10**

Professor Ozpin requested a meeting with both of us. Rin and I argued over meeting this man or not. Ultimately, I gave in, and Rin scheduled a meeting next month.

**Year 2, Day 13**

We decided to unveil the new rocket.

**Year 2, Day 23**

We launched the first Remnan satellite into orbit in probably five thousand years.

While there were celebration from the world, the four kingdoms are aghast and horrified by the possibility. They got in their mind the idea of delivering dust bombs by using rockets. They certainly saw what we can do with our rockets.

They wanted to negotiate, again.
