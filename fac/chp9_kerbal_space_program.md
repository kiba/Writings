# Chapter Nine: Kerbal Space Program

**Day 316**

Phew! Sorry, for not writing in my journal. I been so incredibly busy with building a new kingdom. It was also a fucking headache. Should had quit the first chance we got.

But nooooooo! Rin wanted to play empress, and I got in my big head I could play as an emperor as well. Always wanted to start my own empire.

Look where it got us.

We got three thousand people in Allothmy. That's a drop in the bucket when you consider that five hundred million lives on Remnant. A far cry from seven billion on my home planet, but still mega-huge.

Dawnson still hadn't decided whether to become part of my kingdom, but they're a protectorate by the virtue of being very close. It's even bigger now, with over ten thousand people living there. They're doing brisk trade trading with us and the rest of the world.

Free apartment and power armor suit, and rationing are apparently not enough.

At least it isn't exploding in population size. That would be a huge mess. On the other hand, we're still desperately searching for skillsets. We need more people!

The other kingdoms hadn't decide to screw us over with an arms limitation treaty. Instead, they very much liked the idea of sharing tech.

They're going to be so disappointed with my military robots. It's not really advanced. The real jewel is the logistics and production system, which I am not going to give away so easily.

**Day 320**

The factory in the biter world wasn't well optimized. The only thing I did was to make sure they're running smoothly. I should really send over some workers, but it's hidden from the public for a reason, and I am not ready to trust workers with state secrets just yet.

However, given that the workers are managing the other half, my workload became considerably easier as I shifted some of the production over to Remnant, reducing my footprint in this world.

I am ready to start a rocket factory.

**Day 327**

The rocket spec is pretty damn pitiful. It can only carry one eight hundred kilogram to LEO(Low Earth Orbit), and is certainly not reusable. Hell, the launchpad is basically a nuclear missile silo.

However, the industrial requirement is actually not that large, unlike in the game Factorio.

The difficulty comes with coping with extremely tight tolerance and extreme conditions. It's certainly not making lot of stuff that's the problem, like it was in the game, but the engineering and quality assurance.

I knew that most of my machines aren't really that high tech to begin with.

**Day 331**

Been deploying EHC(Environmental Hazard Cleaner) tech around the base as developed by omni-engineer Rin Furukawa!

Somewhat expensive to make, but everything becomes more environmental friendly.

**Day 333**

I am considering whether to port the linux based Factorio Operating System to Remnant computer devices, given that my own graphene computers are much faster than their.

**Day 338**

Built a satellite and loaded the satellite into the rocket.

Watched the launch with my girlfriend. It didn't experience a RUD(Rapid unplanned assembly) event.

**Day 340**

Satellite looking good so far. I can see the ground now!

Except, there's biters everywhere! Some with different morphology than I had encountered so far. Oh god.

At least there's rich ores to mine on the ground.

**Day 344**

Launched another. Working on a satellite constellation for GPS.
