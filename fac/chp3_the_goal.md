Civilizations required millions, if not billions of people, all with their own pieces of how to run their slice to support civilizations. That's still true today, especially for the most advanced goods and services.

Yet, I am here to build a factory system to achieve a particular goal. The goal was to build a one-off rocket, which by itself required an industrial system in itself. Building rockets, plural, required a much bigger factory and much more quality parts. Those were primitive shit, barely good enough to get off this damn rock.

I wouldn't disparage the ancestors who built them, though. Building an economical launch system was nothing less than a monumental achievement, much more so than simply sending a few men to land on the moon.

Anyway, the bay that stored the equipment were ancient shit, made of regular matters and alloy. Good enough for self-replication and service. Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible for me to build a factory system. Advanced technologies required exotic matters and extremely precise manufacturing process to achieve greater productivity, better strength, or any kind of property you care to name. Apparently, that meant zip to the spacecraft that crashed this god damn planet. Still not going to get me off this planet.

Ancient shit or not, they are the right stuff for the job, and all the production processes using them can all fit them inside my head. That was the most important thing. It wasn't going to be the most efficient or optimized factory in the world. It required people which I don't have.

What equipment are there in the bay? A nanofab, automated miners, belt layers, armsbot, smelter, and a couple of bots with tool fixture.

Not a whole lot to work with if you only consider the equipment, but I got a horde of microcontrollers and motherboards that can be used in all sort of stuff, along with electrical wiring, screws, and a whole bunch of other vitamins.

That'll last me a while.

Of course, then there's the ship itself. I got a nuclear reactor on-board that will provide a steady output of power along with workstations to design shit and a giant hunking library to consult with.

The shit in Earth's history wasn't really meant for one man to design, build, and operate. That's not really a problem. All that stuff is simple. First year stuff.

But first, I'll have to prospect for metals and survey my surrounding.

This world was largely untouched, and shit ton of meteorites rain on this place everyday, showering the world with shit ton of heavy elements. There should be really valuable stuff just on the surface.
