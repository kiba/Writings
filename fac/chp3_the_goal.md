# Chapter Three: The Goal

ROB had trapped me with a mandate. It wasn't until after the crash and the panicking aftermath that I realized that I had been inserted into a setting. My memory of my past life, even my name was wiped, but I do remember playing with factorio, a game about building endless factorio for no apparent reasons.

But I do have a specific goal. The landlubbers are my responsiblity and that I must rescue them. Thus, this involved building a one off rocket, which required an entire industrial system dedicated to it. If I want to build rockets, plural, that would required a much bigger factory and greater automation.

The tools I have are a mispodge of primitive and amazing. I have a nanofab, belt layers, turrets, dimensional pocket containers, and smelters.

Not a whole lot to work with if you only consider the equipment, but I got a horde of microcontrollers and motherboards that can be used in all sort of stuff, along with electrical wiring, screws, and a whole bunch of other vitamins.

That'll last me a while until I set up system to mine all the necessary ores.

Of course, then there's the ship itself. I got a nuclear reactor on-board that will provide a steady output of power along with workstations to design and test new prototypes and a giant hunking library to consult with.

But first, I'll have to prospect for metals and survey my surrounding.

This world was largely untouched, and a boat load ton of meteorites rain on this place everyday, showering the world with shit ton of heavy elements. There should be really valuable stuff just on the surface.

I just hope the landlubbers' armor last long enough for me to get up there.
