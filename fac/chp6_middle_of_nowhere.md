# Chapter Six: Middle of Nowhere

The vast majority of humanity live inside the four city-states; Vale, Atlas, Vacuo, and Mistral, where it's mostly safe and comfortable. There used to be more kingdoms, but they either been absorbed, or broke apart.

A minority of humans decided to live out in the Grimm wilderness. Depending on a person's view, they might be viewed as either hardy settlers or foolish dreamers.

Despite the danger from the Grimm and the environment, the wilderness offered opportunities to make a living. Some of which included mining for Dusts. Independent mining towns tend to pop up like zits only to be slapped down by the Grimm, or the mines are simply exhausted.

Dawn was one of those mining town, but they also struck it rich, while also being on the map, as they are on the path of a well known trade route between Vale and Mistral. That would sustain the town when the richness of the mine ran out.

When the inhabitants of Dawn noticed smoke trails and a bulging greyness from afar, as well reports of destroyed grimm birds, they sent a message to their mother city-state for assistance.

for Qrow, a veteran huntsman, treated this mission like any other. Sure, there was a mystery, and on occasion, it did turn out something interesting. He didn't have any particular expectation.

"We're approaching the probable location," the Vale military pilot said. The dropship tilted to the right until they were in sight of a grey circular layout.

It didn't take long for the set of screaming jet to sway away, not wanting to attract bullets or missiles.

But the images were clear enough, enough to piqued the huntsman's interest, along with everyone else.

The group of dropships disgorged at a location not far from one of their fortress, built on a plain. A voice barked orders to set up perimeter defense and camp. Qrow and the other huntsmen assisted.

Most of the civilians were more hinderance than help, so they were ordered to sit pretty.

It took no time at all. Defensive positions and heavy weapons were positioned and deploy first, then latrines, tents, then everything else.

The initial setup was done in thirty minutes. For sure, there were more to do, but the basic were already there. It was time that the leadership converged.

Qrow was glad that he picked Bartholomew Oobleck for this mission, because whoever built the fortress and the train lines through the wilderness certainly don't belong to any of the kingdoms. The flag was a Gear instead of any of the four symbols.

The other two he did not pick. Colonel Ollie Oliver seemed to be competent, with how he set up camp, and the aeronautic expert he picked up was a relative unknown, Frank Whittle, but Ozpin picked him.

The Colonel set up a holographic display for everyone to see, and played a video gathered from one of the dropship.

"It seemed that someone with the resource of kingdom had set up a fortress and an army," Oliver said, acknowledging the presence of turrets, vehicles, and equipment.
