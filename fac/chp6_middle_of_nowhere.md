# Chapter Six: Middle of Nowhere

The vast majority of humanity live inside the four city-states; Vale, Atlas, Vacuo, and Mistral, where it's mostly safe and comfortable. There used to be more kingdoms, but they either been absorbed, or broke apart.

A minority of humans decided to live out in the Grimm wilderness. Depending on a person's view, they might be viewed as either hardy settlers or foolish dreamers.

Despite the danger from the Grimm and the environment, the wilderness offered opportunities to make a living. Some of which included mining for Dusts. Independent mining towns tend to pop up like zits only to be slapped down by the Grimm, or the mines are simply exhausted.

Dawn was one of those mining town, but they also struck it rich, while also being on the map, as they are on the path of a well known trade route between Vale and Mistral. That would sustain the town when the richness of the mine ran out.

When the inhabitants of Dawn noticed smoke trails and a bulging greyness from afar, as well reports of destroyed grimm birds, they sent a message to their mother city-state for assistance.

for Qrow, a veteran huntsman, treated this mission like any other. Sure, there was a mystery, and on occasion, it did turn out something interesting. He didn't have any particular expectation.

"We're approaching the probable location," the Vale military pilot said. The dropship tilted to the right until they were in sight of a grey circular layout.

It didn't take long for the set of screaming jet to sway away, not wanting to attract bullets or missiles.

But the images were clear enough, enough to piqued the huntsman's interest, along with everyone else.

***

The group of dropships disgorged at a location not far from one of their fortress, built on a plain. A voice barked orders to set up perimeter defense and camp. Qrow and the other huntsmen assisted.

Most of the civilians were more hinderance than help, so they were ordered to sit pretty.

It took no time at all. Defensive positions and heavy weapons were positioned and deployed first, followed by latrines, tents, and the rest.

The initial setup was done in thirty minutes. For sure, there were more to do, but the basic were already there. Deciding that it was enough for now, the leadership converged.

Qrow was glad that he picked Bartholomew Oobleck for this mission, because whoever built the fortress and the train lines through the wilderness certainly don't belong to any of the kingdoms. The flag was a Gear instead of any of the four symbols. Could it be one of those missing kingdoms?

The other two he did not pick. Colonel Ollie Oliver seemed to be competent, with how he set up camp, and the aeronautic expert he picked up was a relative unknown with an unusual name, Frank Whittle, but Ozpin picked him. That was good enough for Qrow.

The Colonel set up a holographic display for everyone to see, and played a video gathered from one of the dropship.

"It seemed that someone with the resource of kingdom had set up a fortress and an army," Oliver said. "There's military vehicles scattered throughout, as well construction equipment, industrial facilities....and..."

"It appeared that our mysterious fortress builder have technologies that aren't available to us," Whittle interjected.

"Right. And they hadn't shot us down, despite being completely capable of doing so. They even pinged us with communication we couldn't understand. Even now, they aren't attacking us."

"Then a diplomatic option is potentially available to us," Oobleck concluded.

"So, you want to get somebody up to their front door and knock, while their defenses are squarely targeting us? Even us huntsmen would get shred to death," Qrow said. "We could just wait and do nothing for a while."

"There's no guarantee that they might contact us, and we have limited resources."

"We could just get supplies at Dawn."

Oliver sighed. "I am not going to stick around longer than necessary. Even Dawn is not really safe. We'll have volunteers approach their gate cautiously. If it look like the robots are reacting or attacking, the volunteers will retreat as quickly as they could."

"Sounds fine to me."

"Wha? Moments ago, you were against contacting them as soon as possible."

"You suggested a reasonable plan that reduce the probability of not getting shred by bullets, and get us home as soon as possible. At least, I won't be involved in the first contact party."

Oliver groaned in frustration.

"Let's communicate to them first via radio on all frequencies we can think of to see if they can understand us," Oobleck suggested. "If not, then we'll try meeting them."

***

Qrow relaxed as he drink from his flask, watching over a very frustrated team of translators saying words over the radio, while getting gibberish back.

It was sort of amusing in a way.

"Can I try?" Oobleck said.

The head translator nodded.

Just like that, Oobleck spoke words in a very ancient language. Then the radio spoke back in that ancient language. It continued for a while, but it was very clear that a breakthrough was made.

***

The veteran huntsman didn't like this one bit. It was just too much to trust a feminine voice's words, not when there's much firepower just waiting to burst out of that fortress.

But Oobleck said it was 'safe' to go, and everyone just trusted him on his judgement. No matter what Qrow proposed, it was all addressed by the professor.

Thus, Qrow was forced to escort a first contact group.

They walked steadily up until now, observing any movements that might be hostile. So far, the turrets were still as day.

A drone flew over the gate, then projected a holographic display.

Qrow and the party could see a blue haired woman with red eyes wearing a crown and a scepter talking animatedly to someone else on the display.

Then she turned her attention to the group, acting all flustered. She bowed and spoke more words that Qrow couldn't understand.

Could it be a threat? His hands were trying very hard not to grip his scythe.

Oobleck spoken again, sounding awfully cheerfully. More words came.

"The gate's opening up," Oobleck said.

He rather be fighting the grimm instead.
