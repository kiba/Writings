# Chapter Twenty-eight: The Summoned Dwarf

Mack MacMuffin stared at the detective. It was all he could do in this accursed place. It was a good thing that he got a lawyer with him.

"Where were you last night when the billionaire Johnathan Swift disappeared?" the detective asked. MacMuffin could hear the accusatory tone underlying his question. MacMuffin scowled at the accusation.

"You can answer that question," MacMuffin's lawyer said.

"Where was I last night? Don't you government folks know where am I just by getting a warrant from the phone company? Huh?" MacMuffin answered with a question.

"You didn't really answer the question," the detective objected.

"I know you been watching my house using your undercover cars, thus you know that you haven't see me left the house until this morning."

"You are the only one left, sir."

"So I am a prime suspect now? Huh? You guys should be protecting me instead!"

The detective did a poker face, revealing no emotion. "We are just trying to find answers to the kidnapping," the police officer offered his own non-answer.

Another thirty minutes passed in which the detective asked further questions about MacMuffin's alibi, but nothing he couldn't answer.

***

"Mr. MacMuffin!" a voice called out for him as MacMuffin and his lawyer exited the police station. Then an avalanche of other voices and their questions poured in as reporters crowded on him.

"What do you think of the missing Five?" "Who do you think is out to get you?" "Your club is about uplifting..."

"SHUT UP!" the dwarf human bellowed. The crowd suddenly became silent. "To answer your question, I don't know who did this, or why and how other fellow club members disappeared. Obviously, I am distressed and scared, yadaydadayda. Good luck and good day to you. Bye."

That only begot more questions from the crowd. The dwarf ignored it all and moved through the crowd before reaching his car.

***

MacMuffin didn't like spending his considerable fortune, but paranoia won out. Almost everyone from the Uplift Society Club disappeared, leaving him alone. The dwarf still didn't know why they targeted the membership of his club, but he thought that the kidnappers might be crazy. To that end, he hired security guards by the dozens just today, and stationed them everywhere on his family's tacky McMansion property. There were also cops on his property as well, but the wealthy software executive didn't trust the cops one bit, since they're the one who accused him of kidnapping.

Outside of his property, there's dozen of police cars and news vans who served as free extra eyes as well. That should make it difficult to infiltrate his mansion.

"I will pay a two thousand dollar bonus to everyone who stayed awake and did their job throughout the night, understand?" MacMuffin said. "Any sleeping on the job, I will not pay, period."

"Yes, sir, I will let my men know so that they will be extra careful and vigilant tonight," the sharply dressed security officer replied.

"Good. Now I must sleep."

MacMuffin, feeling safe and secure, jumped into bed without a thought. Before long, he snored away in a deep sleep.

With no recording and no eyewitness inside his bedroom, the body of Mack MacMuffin wrinkled away, disappearing into thin air.

***

Rainbow colors infused his visual sense.

"OOoohh...trippy!" the dwarf exclaimed.

Then beautiful and random melody filled his ears.

"Niiiiiiiiiccee."

Then, all the sudden, the ceiling was all granite, while his body laid on stone cold marble floor.

The dwarf human blinked several time, until it dawn on him that he might be awake. The wealthy dwarf stood up.

He saw dwarves dressed in highly elaborate costume, one of them as a stereotypical wizard, complete with pointy hat and robe.

"Where the heck am I?" MacMuffin wondered.

"We did it! We did it!" the wizard dwarf exclaimed. "I summoned a hero! A real true hero!" The dwarves broke into celebratory dance and cheers.

It was weird. They were speaking in a language MacMuffin didn't know, yet it was totally comprehensible to him.

"What the heck is this?!" he automatically said in the new language. "Why am I speaking a strange language?"

The wizard cosplayer stopped dancing. "Oh oh oh yes. We summoned you through a ritual."

"Wha?" Memories rushed in at a dizzingly rate. "YOU MUST BE MY KIDNAPPERS!" The accusation went through the dwarves, knocking some of them off their feet.

The dwarf human hyperventilated as he started to look around for a escape route.

"I assured you. We did not kidnap you," the wizard said. "The ritual circle summoned a suitable hero for our fortress, especially in time of need."

MacMuffin snatched a battle axe off a fallen dwarf. "Oh yeah? Did the ritual ask if the 'hero' wanted to be summoned." The human waved the battle axe, terrifying his kidnappers, causing them to step back! "Well?"

"Please be reasonable!" the wizard begged.

"Let me go!"

"We didn't restrain you or anything like that!"

"Very well, you will let me outside this building."

As soon he escorted a terrified dwarf to the outside. The human dwarf realized something was seriously wrong.

There were more of shorties like him in the street! It wasn't the modern street that he expected.

"IT STANK!" MacMuffin complained. There were manure in the street, even if those manure were slowly swept away by a crew of dwarves.

***

It had been three years since he was whisked away to the Fortress of MegaGear. He cleaned up and prohibited shit in the street, introduced a railway system, fended off several invasions from goblins, all the while heroically keeping the fortress intact through some very hard time. Now they were starting to mass produce steel.

MacGuffin done so much of a good job that they elevated him into a monarch.

Except, there was one thing on his mind that he wished for. He wanted to go home.

The human held a scepter as he looked out from his balcony, overseeing a vast fortress town of fifty thousand and growing.

The fortress grew from a population of only a hundred to that number in the span of only ten years.

"When will I'll be able to go home, my wizard?" MacGuffin questioned.

"My king...you must understand! We need you-"

"Answer the damn question!"

"We're slowly getting there..."

"Are you trying to obstruct progress?"

"No!" the wizard said, horrified. "We would never do that to our great and wonderful king!"

Once again, the king felt a great reluctance to investigate the wizard. The old man was just too useful as an adviser and a mage. He was loathed to throw away such a highly trained resource, especially when the wizard didn't have a lying bone in his body.

There were loud thumps on the door.

"Who is it?" the wizard asked.

"A message!"

"You may come in."

A heavily breathing dwarf stumbled into the room. "Somebody passed the test!"
