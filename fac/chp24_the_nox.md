# Chapter Twenty-four: The Nox

Plants literally grow on the Nox, who are more or less really advanced humans. They also love to mediate and discuss philosophy, which caused no end of annoyance to the MSC commander. However, they can sense aura, and they really want to see what the Grimm are all about.

I decided that a super powerful race is worth the trouble since we might be able to no-sell or eliminate the Grimm if they can figure out what they are. A bunch of soulless monsters that prey on humans can't possibly be good, right?

Despite their declared intention of studying the Grimm, we seemed to be sidetracked into a tour of a farm. My wife is also nowhere to be found, saying that she's on an important meeting. Damn it! Where are you?! Why did you desert me?

Back to the factory tour, the Nox in their normal human disguise listened to a tour guide talking the marine environment underground to grow seedweed and marine animals. Right aside us was a pool of water that we can look into.

It wasn't certainly my doing. The state was in the business of providing bland rations, security, and basic infrastructure, not cultivating luxury food.

"It is impressive that such a young people such as your were able to build an entire system for growing food deep underground," Lya, the leading Nox, said. I believe she is the Nox woman who appeared on Stargate-SG1, though I have to check Earth media. "Even if that is growing animals for food consumption."

"We're working on directly cultivating meat cells," I said. "It's much more efficient, and we don't have to grow entire animal with lives and feelings. Obviously it's not ready for prime time, due to the difficulty of scaling it." Which would basically make this place obsolete. Whether or not the owner of this business has a plan for adapting to that technology is another matter.

"You could change your dietary need to only require plant matters," Lya suggested. "It's more efficient than growing meat, which will require nutrients from plants."

"I don't think that will be easy to achieve, Elder Lya."

The Nox nodded. "It is not...necessary. Animals would be uninvolved in the production of cultured meat. We have stopped eating any meat because we had separated from the Alterans before developing any technology to grow meat on an industrial scale."

That's a new one for me. There's so much that we don't know about Nox society and civilization. There's only so much you can glean from MSC sociologists when they spent most of their time with the Nox mediating and discussing extremely abstract philosophical thoughts.

"Oh? Would you help us make production of artificial meat scalable?"

"We have a prohibition on sharing technologies with younger societies such as your," Lya said. "But with such enlightened thought, it might be possible to lift the prohibition." My head was lighting up with thoughts of Nox bioengineering. "However, even growing cultured meats at large scale will enable new path in your technological development that may lead to social ills and abuse in your civilization. The decision to uplift would not be taken lightly."

"Damn."

It's a good thing that they didn't demand us to be pacifist wussies or stop killing Grimm.

"It's about time that we should investigate the Grimm," she said.

"Yep. It's about time."

Let's get the show on the road.

Lya seemed completely unconcerned about capturing a Grimm, as she didn't bother asking questions about security. Several Nox and her rode with us into the wilderness via a bullhead, while we were surrounded by several dozen commandos as protection details.

We dropped down in the middle of a forest, while the bullhead and my power armor started gorging war machines by the boatload. Dimensional storage is bullshit.

"There's no need for you and your men to be involved in the capture of a 'Grimm'," Lya said. "Leave it to us."

"I am concerned that you will get hurt," I said. "You got no armor and no weapon."

"I know, but the Nox people are not incapable of protecting themselves. We have power."

Afterward, we followed them closely as they zeroed in on a Grimm. Better safe than sorry.

Once a Ursa was found, the Nox simply waved their hands, freezing a Ursa in existence. Then the Nox simply made the Grimm disappeared into thin air using some sort of weird arm wave.

"Where did it go?" I asked.

"It is similar to your stasis pod and your dimensional storage," she said.

That's it? It was the least dramatic capture of a Grimm ever, and I am not complaining about that.

It actually took me longer to pick all of my robots than it is for the rest of the trips, because my robot army was so spread out to ensure 'protection' even though it was unnecessary.

The men have a quiet laugh about the whole thing.

"So what did you found out?" My wife questioned, as she laid against me on a couch. There was no TV program on, or anything from the CCTS. It was just us cuddling against each other in our living room.

I shrugged. "We don't know much yet, but Lya said the Nox can feel strong negative emotions coming from the Grimm. Contrary to beliefs, they are not soulless monsters."

"What are they then?"

"Monsters, apparently. Their souls are twisted and broken. Lya was very displeased about what was done. She promised to find a solution for getting rid of the abomination from our world and purifying their souls."

"That's great news!"

"One step closer to cleaning Salem's clock or what will happen to us. Do you think I should have told Lya about Salem?"

"I don't know, hon."

"I think I'll talk to Ozpin about this."

Rin Furukawa suddenly stood up in front of me. She stopped being so lovey dovey, and her face turned very serious.

"Karl Gearworth," she said. "I need to tell you something."

"What is it?"

My wife smiled. "I am pregnant."

I choked on air after that.
