# Chapter Twenty-four: The Nox

Plants literally grow on the Nox, who are more or less really advanced humans. They also love to mediate and discuss philosophy, which caused no end of annoyance to the MSC commander. However, they can sense aura, and they really want to see what the Grimm are all about.

I decided that a super powerful race is worth the trouble since we might be able to no-sell or eliminate the Grimm if they can figure out what they are. A bunch of soulless monsters that prey on humans can't possibly be good, right?

Despite their declared intention of studying the Grimm, we seemed to be sidetracked into a tour of a farm. My wife is also nowhere to be found, saying that she's on an important meeting. Damn it! Where are you?! Why did you desert me?

Back to the factory tour, the Nox in their normal human disguise listened to a tour guide talking the marine environment underground to grow seedweed and marine animals. Right aside us was a pool of water that we can look into.

It wasn't certainly my doing. The state was in the business of providing bland rations, security, and basic infrastructure, not cultivating luxury food.

"It is impressive that such a young people built an entire system for growing food deep underground," Lya, the leading Nox, said. "Even if that is growing animals for food consumption."

"We're working on directly cultivating meat cells," I said. "It's efficient, and we don't have to grow entire animals. Obviously it's not ready for prime time, due to the difficulty of scaling it." Which would basically make this place obsolete. Whether or not the owner of this business has a plan for adapting to that technology is another matter.

"You could change your dietary need to only require plant matters," Lya suggested. "I believe that your people has access to genetic engineering. Nonetheless, growing meat culture is an acceptable ethical decision."

"Oh? Would you help us learn to grow artificial meat?"
