# Chapter Twenty-four: The Nox

Did you know that plants literally grew on the Nox's head? It's all a result of genetic engineering, but I am not sure why would they want plants to grow on their head. It does strongly reinforce their space hippy image though. They also love to mediate and discuss philosophy, which caused no end of annoyance to the MSC commander. However, they can sense aura, and they really want to see what the Grimm are all about.

I decided that a super powerful race is worth the trouble since we might be able to no-sell or eliminate the Grimm if they can figure out what they are. A bunch of soulless monsters that prey on humans can't possibly be good, right?

Despite their declared intention of studying the Grimm, we got sidetracked into a tour of a farm. My wife was also nowhere to be found, saying that she's in an important meeting. Damn it! Where are you?! Why did you desert me?

Back to the factory tour, the Nox in their normal human disguise listened to a tour guide. The company who brought this property built an entire marine environment underground to grow seedweed and marine animals. Right beside us was a thin transparent wall which was keeping us dry and safe from the pool of water.

It wasn't certainly my doing. The state was in the business of providing bland rations, security, and basic infrastructure, not cultivating tasty marine animals for consumption.

"It is impressive that such a young people such as your were able to build an entire system for growing food deep underground," Lya, the leader of the Nox delegates, said. I believe she is the Nox woman who appeared on Stargate-SG1, though my memory about the series was rather rusty. "Even if that is growing animals for food consumption."

"We're working on directly cultivating meat cells," I said. "It's much more efficient, and we don't have to grow entire animal with lives and feelings. Obviously it's not ready for prime time, due to the difficulty of scaling it." Which would basically make this place obsolete. Whether or not the owner of this business has a plan for adapting to that technology is another matter.

"You could change your dietary need to only require plant matters," Lya suggested. "It's more efficient than growing meat, which will require nutrients from plants."

"I don't think that will be easy to achieve, Elder Lya."

The Nox nodded. "It is not...necessary. Though we do note that animals would be uninvolved in the production of cultured meat. It is a good ethical choice, a path we did not take. We have stopped eating any meat when we separated from the Alterans eons ago. As such, we did not develop any technologies regarding the industrial production of cultured meat."

That's a new one for me. There's so much that we don't know about Nox society and civilization. There's only so much you can glean from MSC sociologists when they spent most of their time with the Nox mediating and discussing extremely abstract philosophical thoughts.

"Oh? Would you help us make production of artificial meat scalable?"

"We have a prohibition on sharing technologies with younger societies such as your," Lya said. "But with such enlightened thought shown by your people, it might be possible to lift the prohibition." My head was lighting up with thoughts of Nox bioengineering and what it could do. "However, even growing cultured meats at large scale will enable new paths in your technological development that may lead to social ills and abuse of such technologies in your civilization. The decision to uplift would not be taken lightly."

"Damn."

It's a good thing that they didn't demand us to be pacifist wussies or stop killing Grimm.

"It's about time that we should investigate the Grimm," she said.

"Yep. It's about time."

Let's get the show on the road.

Lya seemed completely unconcerned about capturing a Grimm, as she didn't bother asking questions about security. Several Nox and her rode with us into the wilderness on a bullhead, while we were surrounded by several dozen commandos as protection details.

We dropped down in the middle of a forest, while the bullhead and my power armor started gorging war machines by the boatload. Dimensional storage is bullshit.

"There's no need for you and your men to be involved in the capture of a 'Grimm'," Lya said. "Leave it to us."

"I am concerned that you will get hurt," I said. "You got no armor and no weapon."

"I know, but the Nox people are not incapable of protecting themselves. We have power and abilities beyond what you have shown to us."

Afterward, we followed them closely as they zeroed in on a Grimm. Better safe than sorry.

Once a Ursa was found, the Nox simply waved their hands, freezing a Ursa in existence. Then the Nox simply made the Grimm disappears into thin air using some sort of weird arm wave.

"Where did it go?" I asked.

"It is similar to your stasis pod and your dimensional storage," she said.

That's it? It was the least dramatic capture of a Grimm ever, and I am not complaining about that. After that, we took in a several dozen of specimen with no problem as well.

It actually took me longer to pick all of my robots than it is for the rest of the trips, because my robot army was so spread out to ensure 'protection' even though it was completely unnecessary in this situation.

When we went home, my men had a quiet laugh about the whole thing.

"So what did you found out?" My wife questioned, as she laid against me on a couch. There was no TV program on, or anything from the CCTS. It was just us cuddling against each other in our living room.

I shrugged. "We don't know much yet, but Lya said the Nox can feel strong negative emotions coming from the Grimm. Contrary to what we thought, they are not soulless monsters. However, the Nox said that they don't know how long the research will take."

"What are they then?"

"Monsters, apparently. Their souls are twisted and broken. Lya was very displeased about what was done. She promised to find a solution for getting rid of the abomination from our world and purifying their souls."

"That's great news!"

"One step closer to cleaning Salem's clock. Do you think I should have told Lya about Salem?"

"I don't know, hon."

"I think I'll talk to Ozpin about this."

"Yeah, that's a good idea. Even though he is exposed and everyone knows about Salem now. Maybe you should just tell her about Salem."

I think she's right.
