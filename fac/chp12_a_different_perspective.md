# Chapter Twelve: A Different Perspective.

Hi. I am a SI, and I cheated to get in into Beacon Academy by faking my transcript, taking Jaune Arc's place in canon. I know that's lame, but you got to do what you have to do. I also barely passed the test, needing to be rescued by team RWBY at several points. Glad that they're still together in spite of a nail, though their partners are switched up. It's BWRY, pronounced as blueberry.

"Why are we going to the CCTS?" Phyrra asked, confused and still in her formal dress. This was supposed to be a dance night.

"Tell us! Tell us!" Nora begged.

I smiled. "It's a surprise." The impact of Mechatron did nothing to butterfly the plot away, nor did it prevent team RWBY from taking risks. Though it's weird that the headmaster came in and admonished team RWBY for fighting against the White Fang.

"What surprise?" Nora questioned.

"Nora," Ren said, scolding her. "We aren't going to be surpr-"

The CCTS tower exploded, its top floor scattering debris to the ground below.

"Oh no!" I yelled.

"Why the hell are you not at the dance!?" a stern voice questioned.

"Freedom of movement?" I responded with a non-sequitur, starring down Glynda Goodwitch. It was one of my trait, the ability to lie so plainly and keep the story together in my head.

A black body dropped straight down, revealing Cinder.

"Run!"

"We're going to fight! This is our tow-"

Goodwitch slapped me hard. I was so shocked that my mouth was left gapping. "Brat. You're only going to get in the way."

Phyrra dragged my shoulder away, and eventually we started running away from the tower. There were loud bangs, booms, and clashes of metals.

Then, a siren sounded. It was the signal to retreat to safety. Faces started appearing on the emergency system. It was the cast of villains: Adam, Emerald, Neopolitan, Mercury, Cinder, and Roman. After seventeen years, I can finally remember their faces so clearly again.

Another boom went off. Atlasian soldiers started flooding everywhere we go.

What are we doing if not fighting the forces of darkness? What am I doing, if I am not stopping the fall of Vale?

I stopped in my track.

"Blue!" Phyrra called out to me.

"I want to fight those criminals."

Phyrra looked angry. "You're not going anywhere or do anything without your teammates."

"So, you're coming?"

"No," Ren answered for my second in command.

"If you're so stubborn to die, than we're going to drag you kicking and screaming with us," Phyrra said.

Then, memories flashed back to me. I remembered how Phyrra died, and how Ruby tried to rescue her, but it was too late too little. We aren't going to be strong enough to face Cinder and her minions, not until we have enough training.

We fled to the safest location we can think of.

**Ozpin's Office**

According to the news, Cinder unceremoniously died of blood loss as she was rushed to the hospital. She faced not one but up to four huntsmen who awaited in ambush that night, which apparently included Professor Ozpin.

To my right, I could see Goodwitch's right arm slung in a cast.

Ozpin looked worse. You could see bruises on his face, but also bandages everywhere. He moved ever slowly, not even bothering to pick up his coffee. He drank his from a straw instead.

"Did you fight Cinder?" I wondered.

"Yes. I did. It was not an easy fight," he answered.

"I am glad that you chose to follow my instruction," Goodwitch said. "Many more people could have died."

I gulped.

"Why am I here?" I queried.

"You were prepared to fight," Ozpin stated. My heart dropped into the stomach. How did he know? Where did he get his information? "So I began looking into your background and history. You wrote about a planet called Earth."

"I-I-I am a blood and flesh Remnan!" I protested.

"I also noted that you cheated to get in there. It reminded me of a particular student who was rejected by the admission officer, though the transcript you showed me was less...stellar."

Holy shit. I am fucked.

"Let's start with Earth. You should know some fact about your world. Do you know what an atomic bomb is?"

I am terrified, like a deer in headlight. I couldn't even utter a word.

"I am not sure why you are so terrified about Earth," Ozpin continued. "It's not a crime. In fact, I know at least two people from Earth."

"Who? Where? How?" My mind turned to Mechatron and their rulers. They were a complete anomaly. I couldn't find any indication that they were from Earth. It might be because I forgot the English language entirely when I reincarnated.

"You will answer truthfully, before I answer that question."

I nodded in desperation.

"Did you withheld foreknowledge of future events when you could have told me?"

I nodded.

"Did you lie on the transcript about your capability?"

I nodded.

"For lying on your transcript, you are hereby expelled for one semester from Beacon Academy. There is no crime for withholding crucial information that may save lives, but the next time you do have such information, I absolutely implore you to do so."

"What?"

"If you had just lied to me once more, than I might have expelled and blacklisted for a year. As it is, you took the place of one other promising student from being able to study at Beacon Academy."

I dropped to my fleet and began bawling immediately. My life is over.

The teachers stood still as I tried to hold back my tears, but then my emotion overcame me. They showed no absolutely no emotion, neither pity nor anger.

"Blue, do you want to talk about it?" Phyrra asked, concerned about her teammate. I was packing my clothes and my armor away.

"No," I said, sniffing.

"Where will you be going?"

"I don't know? Mechatron?"

"Why?"

I looked into her beautiful eyes. Will Phyrra still die now that the future changed?

"Relatives," I said. It was in a way technically correct.

"I thought you didn't have family."

"Apparently, I do now."

"For, what it's worth. You're a great leader."

"Yeah, but I lied, and I almost got us killed."

Once I was done packing my luggage and approached the door, I looked at Phyrra one last time.

"I love you," I said.

"You picked a terrible time to confess, Blue," Phyrra stated. Her eyes looked downcast. "Sorry. You are a great friend and a great teammate, but I don't feel anything about you."

Fuck. Can't anything go right for me?
