# Chapter Eleven: Consolidation

**Year 2, Day 27**

Lot of things happened all at once.

Dawn finally gave up remaining independent, choosing to become part of Mechatron. At this time, population wasn't growing at a terrible rate every month. We seemed to have hit a plateau. That's a huge relief, because I need time to get my shit together.

The four kingdoms signed a treaty with me to form the SETO Or Space Exploration Treaty Organization.

We will share rocket designs and manufacturing techniques. I realized that much of my logistics and production advantage will dissipate, but I am betting on having a more functional city than them, and I know that I need to share more technologies with Remnant, but it can't be against the interest of my kingdom.

In that treaty was also an agreement to not militarize warfare or build ICBMs. It's an unfortunate clause, because I want to wipe out Salem from Remnant with a kinetic strike, but I also snuck in a subclause that authorized SETO to build an international space military to defend against threats external to Remnant. That should hopefully nullify the other subclause.

The treaty mollified the kingdoms, and I can get back to doing what I like instead of what I hate.

My empress and I also decided to release the Factorio OS to the world. They never heard of 'open source software' before. It's a very foreign thought to them, but not to Rin.

Hosted a meeting with the Wizard of Oz. Explained to him everything I knew about RWBY, and took him to the archaeological site underneath, letting him appreciate what the ancestors of Remnan accomplished.

With the secrets told, the whole Cinder plot is now his responsibility, though I offered assistance.

**Year, Day 35**

Did a bunch of things with Dawn. I built a railway to Dawn and started to rebuild Dawn's infrastructure from the ground up. With Dawn giving me better access to Dust veins, I ordered my TBM and mining equipment to go there and start digging a new mine.

Did I mentioned I have ministers for quite a while now? A lie detection program allowed me to select honest ministers with the right experience so I don't have to work so hard doing background check and clever interview, not that I think it would do us any good. Neither Rin and I knew anything about governing a country, so we delegated as much as we can get away with. Politics unfortunately was still something that I cannot delegate so easily, though I have advisers for that.

I expanded my welfare program to include universal healthcare, funded on the back of only one tax: the recommended by economists but almost universally ignored land-value tax. It's a good thing that with guaranteed housing and power armor, some of our doctors are actually willing to work for peanuts. The salary saved are then spent somewhere else.

Our population finally stopped exploding as well, which was a relief, because I need to keep ahead by burning dusts in generators(more wind dusts, please!) and building more solar panels. Factorio solar panels are really good, and so are their batteries. The solar panels are sixty percent efficient in converting sunlight to electricity. That's a crazy number back home.

**Year 2, Day 44**

A Schnee Dust Company representative approached us to sell their mine in Dawn, citing unprofitability due to intense competition.

After haggling, I brought their mine. Their employees are now mine.

**Year 2, Day 46**

The data are in. My economist told me that real estate prices in Allothmy are actually stable, taking into account my planned expansion of space, which was intended to be predictable.

Dawn is taking a beating much to the very loud complaint of property owners there, but they knew what was going to happen when they annexed themsleves to my kingdom.

I am so glad that I can just implement an economist's proposal without having to deal with the fucking political class.

**Year 2, Day 56**

Whittle is fucking amazing. He resolved all fourteen launch failures and slipped it through peer review while the kingdoms didn't find anything suspicious, and it's now in the blueprints.

**Year 2, Day 61**

My girlfriend?wife?co-ruler and I decided on a rotation schedule. We would each take turn in ruling the country, and doing our engineering and science pursuits.

**Year 2, Day 69**

Rin reminded me that the Vytal Festival is coming up and she wanted to see it in person.

I told her in no uncertain term: "No fucking way."

It turned into a big fight before we stopped talking to each other the whole day, even through dinner.

**Year 2, Day 73**

We chaired the first SETO conference on rocket designs. We noticed that seventy-five percent of them didn't like Whittle, while only a quarter were positive.

I knew Whittle pissed off his fellow collaborators something fierce, but what can I do about his personality?

Anyway, the conference spiraled into a three hours argument about the best way to approach rocket development.

Rin came up with a compromise. The engineers will vote for the top three rocket designs through preferential voting via a blind ballot. Then they would be divided up into three teams and have nine months to come up with a winning design.

At the end of the day, three designs were finally chosen. Whittle's design didn't win, so he grudgingly joined the design team with the proposal most similar to his. I believed his team will beat everybody else.

On our existing rocket: it's reliable enough that we're launching them everyday until failure. Whenever it failed, engineers get together to perform a root cause analysis so that it will be more reliable.

**Year 2, Day 79**

The city of Vale extended an invitation to us for the Vytal festival. Rin accepted. I grumbled.

**Year 2, Day 84**

The Schnee Dust Company closed down its mine in Dawn filed a lawsuit through all the kingdoms against us, citing anticompetitive measures.

Hypocrite.

Despite the lawsuit, we decided not to disbar Schnee products from moving through our kingdom.

**Year 2, Day 105**

With our launch effort we built up a substantial constellation of satellites, even tested experimental technologies, though we did lose some satellites.

People across Remnant are already using the satellite network to communicate and navigate as more and more devices are becoming available.

Speaking of markets and money, the kingdom is doing very well on the market selling our power armors. Statistics said it's the largest export beside our dust. It's very cheap for us to make, and I made sure to open source every last component, down to the graphene based chips, even if they can't manufacture it. I am of a very firm belief that everyone should have power armor and should own it completely.

Businesses are getting ballistic at us, filing record number of trade complaints, saying that we are anticompetitive. I hired more lawyers to prepare for the upcoming battles in courts.

Pfft. I made a very healthy margin on those power armor. They are just not good enough.

Some shops opened up that specialized in modding Mechatronic components, making bespoke goods. That's fine with me, as long as they aren't killing someone with the products. Already, somebody are already starting to make copies of the components we're selling.

Phew, it's already been three months and I been very busy for the last two weeks prepping for the Vytal festival, making sure that my soldiers are stationed where they need to be to help secure the event from Cinder and her minions. They'll be working with the Atlastian military as well. In the event of a worst case scenario, my entourage will be extracted via a bullhead by elite huntsmen.
