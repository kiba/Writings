# Chapter Twenty-two: Earth

May Rose just punched the neighborhood bully right in the stomach.

Here he was, on the ground, crying out for his mama, while a classmate of her hid behind her back. It was just right outside school too.

It was just a punch, right? Henry deserve it, right? He did tried to extort John out of his lunch money.

"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!" an adult bellowed.

Rose turned her head to the source. The moment she did that, she knew that she was in big trouble.

***

The grade schooler swung her legs while sitting on a chair, mindful of the conversation that was taking place within the principal office. It was muffled, but she could hear the tone of the voices.

It was fast paced, and sharp. That wasn't how adults supposed to act. Even when mama was angry with her, mama's  voice was very calm.

Finally, one of the adults stomped out before dragging Henry by the ear.

John's papa hugged John instead.

Finally Mama came out, looking very tired. May knew who she looked like anywhere. Red streak and white hair with grey eyes, she was very distinctive.

May inherited that look as well. When her teachers said that she shouldn't be dyeing her hairs, mama has to get a several letters from doctors to prove that it was all natural.

"You dodge that bullet, kiddo," her mama said.

"I am not going to get suspended?" May asked, worried.

"No. Let's go home."

***

"May, you can't use violence to solve your problems anymore," mama said, as she drove the car to main street.

"Why not?"

"Because...one of these days...you're going to get in trouble and I am not going to be able to get you out."

"But I punched him, because he was about to punch me, and John!"

"I know. I believe you. But, it's frowned on these days. That is just not what people do."

"That's dumb."

"I agree that's dumb. Do you remember Abel?"

"Yeah. He moved away, because Abel was playing outside with nobody looking out for him. Abel's parents went to jail."

"Right. That what will happen to you if you keep fighting. I will go to jail."

All of a sudden, a series of events flashed before May's eyes, starting with mama's arrest, then the horde of news vans parked right outside of her house, and then finally being made to live with nasty foster parents.

"Nooooooo!"

"You'll need to start learning conflict-resolution skills. Don't worry, sweetie, I'll get you some help."

Finally, the car stopped, parking right outside a private eyes' office.

"I'll be right back," mama said, before scrolling down the window, lest her daughter gets heatstroke.

Mama end up here at least once a month, because May's mama wasn't like any mom. She only remembered thirteen years of her life, but mommy was a lot older than that. She went to this place in the hope of getting back what she lost.

May didn't really understood the concept for a long time.

Mama had to explain to her through bedtime stories about people who lost memories.

Finally, mama came back. She looked a bit sad. May didn't want her to go because it made mama sad, but mama will always go regardless of what May wants.

The door opened. "Kiddo, ready for lunch?" she said.

"Yeah!" May enthused.

***

An adult drawn May's attention while they were walking to May's favorite restaurant.

She didn't know why, but she felt compelled. There was nothing about the man that made him stand out. He was a boring person in a boring place with boring person, except for mama and May of course.

Then he started saying words in a language to mama that May didn't recognize the slightest.

"I am sorry, what?" mama said.

"Oops. Sorry, I thought you might be from my king-, I mean country," the person with brown hair said.

"Aside, from a weirdly colored hair, I look just like everybody else. Though it's hard to say since I lost my memories thirteen years ago."

"Ah, in that case, can you direct me to a pawnshop? I am in need of some cash."

"Sure thing...go to.."

May looked at him even as he departed. There was something different about that person.

"Why are you looking at him, sweetie?" her mama asked.

"I don't know. He's strange."

"Ah. I thought too."

***

May found a new cool anime series to watch, called RWBY. The main heroine has the same last name as her, which she regarded as a funny coincidence.

The girl binged through it on her laptop.

By the end of the series, May was crying. No fair! She thought it was going to be about cute girls doing cute things and killing monsters. Stupid show!

She closed the laptop and went to get some lemonade.

Something caught her eyes in the living room.

There was two photographs. One was before mama lost her memories. She was with two little girls and the papa of those girls. She explained that they were her sisters.

May waited for many years, waiting to meet them. She never did.

Now that she thought about it, they looked like RWBY characters. May giggled at the coincidence.

Then her eyes drawn on the photo. There was her papa and mama together, together with baby May. This was before papa passed away. May noticed a tiny tear flowing down her face.

Blah! She must get lemonade.

***

May returned to the living room only to find mama watching the news. There was a thirteen cars pile up and something about a miracle.

"Hey!" May said.

"What's wrong?" mama asked.

"It's that man on main street."

It took a moment. "You're right! That person just saved people lives just by ripping apart cars. That supposed to be...impossible."

"Who are you sir?" the reporter on the scene asked.

"I am an explorer from another world," the brown hair man said. "I just so happen to be at the wrong time and wrong place."

"What the heck is he saying?" mama wondered.
