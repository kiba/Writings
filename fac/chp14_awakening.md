# Chapter Fourteen: Choices

The jonin ninja struggled to open her eyes, her eyelids welded shut by a thin layer of mucus. When her eyes opened up, it was a blur. More blinking cleared everything up.

In that one moment, she realized something very strange. She should be dead.

"KAI!" she yelled. "KAI! KAI! KAI!"

The illusion failed to dissipate. The bedroom was still there. Multiple discrepancies began filtering to her sense.

There were lights, but no flame. Sealing? Cooling air coming from what looked like vents. Was it cold outside?

She noticed the glasses on the table, which was made with very fine craftmanship. It must have cost a fortune to acquire. That cued her into the decorations. They were highly intricate, of very good quality, with designs she never seen anywhere in the elemental nations. Clearly, whoever owned this place is loaded.

Illusions of light projected into her room, revealing a person in a suit of metal armor.

"Hello," he said. "Am I get you language right?"

The jonin pinpointed the voice almost immediately, coming from black object.

"Excuse me? Where am I? Where's the kids?"

"Took care. Wounds? Healed."

"Take me to them! Right now!"

The jonin found herself hyperventilating. She forced herself to breathe.

The door opened.

"Follow light red, yes?"

The uneasy jonin stepped outside into the hallway. Once there, she walked toward the red lights. Everything seemed to be made of metal, more metal than anyone could possibly have in the Elemental Nations.

"Sensei?" The adult ninja made out one of the kids. "Sensei!" Teacher and children rushed together toward each other resulting in a group hug.

"Where-where Ka-," a boy with a sharp jawline said. The adult gestured to keep mouth shut. "I mean Saito-sensei?"

The hologram appeared again.

"Where's the other adult? The one in his late-thirty?" the woman asked the hologram.

"Sorry? Not-understand?"

"There's one more."

The figured frown, slacking slightly, before he shook his head. "Death. Couldn't save." Was he lying? How much could she trust his words? Are they an enemy?

She already made too many enemies, and her team couldn't afford one more. Especially when they are in an unknown environment with unknown abilities.

"Let us see the body," she demanded.

Ayako Nene never gave her real name to her interrogators. The redhead was disinclined to tell them personal information that could be used against her.

Yet, she also found herself giving away substantial information. Sometime, she thought that they were very ignorant, but they also has uncanny knowledge as well. They somehow deduced that her team were agents of Jiraya as soon as she explained the Sanin to them.

"So, Nene-san, why did you become a missing-nin?" the armored woman asked.

Their interrogation techniques differed from those in the elemental nation. They were polite and well mannered, and they always try to make her comfortable. Somehow, they're also very good at catching lies. When they did caught her lie, they may ask the question again, or ask her reason for lying.

She lied about her name and her personal background, yet they never really came back to it. Why?

"It wasn't just the six of us. There used to be more, before Zabuza-sama took them out. We defected because we thought we are going to die," the ninja said. "Our kage wanted to annex the Land of Noodle to secure the food supply, rather than be forced to import food from other nations. Water country never produced enough food to feed its own population. We are afraid that the annexation will upset Konohagakure, plunging the elemental nations into another shinobi world war. The last war was brief, but it also inflicted terrible losses."

"And those genin?"

"Shinigami-sensei sold the lie to the ninja taskforce that they were on a suicidal mission, and they were chosen for being problem ninjas. It was a beautiful half-lie; the trouble ninjas were in fact chosen by Shinigami-sensei herself. That was how my genin unwittingly ended up missing-nins."

"Those are children; child soldiers. They don't deserve that," the interviewer said, disapprovingly. "Yet, they're your students, and you are like a foster mother to them."

"We did what we have to do to survive," Nene said. "Ultimately, I deserted our group of missing-nins, and the genin willingly come with me as well, because they believed that their survival is better with me. Through two years on the run, we forged a very strong bond fighting together."

"And your personal history? You half fabricated details about your life and what you really have done."

***

For several days, she and her genin tried to learn about security details and capabilities so that they could escape. Then she was shown what would happen to her if she tried to escape. Of course, they were given under 'friendly demonstrations'. At that point, she told her genin to be patient and to gather information covertly.

Of course, the joke were on her team.

Later, she realized that all of her interaction with this foreign power were all recorded by what they called security cameras and microphones.

Her team ended up cooperating, and in response, they were rewarded for their effort. They were given more freedom to explore, interacts with personnels in a more friendly manner, as well learn from books and other media.

"You can apply for asylum with us," a man with a prominent 'X-shaped' scar said, spreading out paperworks on a table for Nene and her genin to see. They expected more interrogation again, but a different person came in, not evening wearing a metal suit. The gentleman was dressed even more weirdly than the soldiers that guard them.

"Asylum? You're serious?" Nene said.

"Our empress had proven quite stubborn, arguing and advocating for your team, against her husband's wishes and paranoia about ninjas."

"What would you have done if that weren't the case?"

"As soon as treatment of your injuries was done, we would have dumped you right back where you fought your battle. We would also try to wipe your memories of your treatment as well."

"What is the condition of asylum?"

"You will be allowed to interact with our citizenry and live out your lives, provided that you keep your identity and abilities a secret. One final warning: once you accepted asylum, you will not be allowed to go back where you came from."

Nene looked at her genin. She felt unease about abandoning the surface, but the underground life was far easier and less arduous than living as missing-nins. Her genin all collectively shook their head.

"I told you that I wanted to change the Elemental Nations for the better," she said. "I don't think my genin and I are willing to give up on that. Sorry, I have to pass."

A hologram appeared, revealing a very different metallic figure from what she had seen. "I am the emperor," this unknown person said. "And I understand and desire the same thing: to reduce suffering for all. If you become the agent of my wife and I and further the interest of my nation and my people, I can help you with that."
