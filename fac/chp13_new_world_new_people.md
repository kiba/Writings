# Chapter Thirteen: New World, New People

**Year 2, Day 112**

Cinder is dead. A Salem plot foiled? Stay vigilant, Remnant.

**Year 2, Day 123**

The Vytal cultural festival begun.

Some of our Mechatron representatives are displaying Chikyuu cultural work.

The underground isn't a secret by all means, but it isn't open to the public either. It's only opened to archaeologists like Professor Oobleck(Yes, he is an archaeologist, historian, and ancient language expert at the same time).

There's a serious denial of their very beautiful cultural heritage coming from a significant proportion of Remnant, because some believed me to be a servant of the Grimm.

By the way, the underground also included the above city portion which was since buried.

**Year 2, Day 130**

There's something beautiful about being able to test frequently by waiting for the next's day rocket's launch. It's not a big deal if the prototype just fails in orbit, unless the rocket blows up.

Even then, it usually takes a few days to a few weeks before my facility started manufacturing rockets again.

We're fast perfecting a prototype that will let us access the megaship.

**Year 2, Day 134**

I learned that Doctor Whittle hired a gopher and assistant named Blue, another Earthling. Apparently, Blue got booted out of Beacon Academy for cheating.

Ozpin emailed me with a warning about Blue's hoarding of important, lifesaving information.

I told Doctor Whittle about Blue's tendency to do this. He promised to impress the youth on this.

**Year 2, Day 136**

The tournament began.

Rin and I decided not to not awaken our aura, because it wasn't worth the effort. We're not fighters.

Whittle's huntress wife did some readings on ours, blindfolded.

She said that my soul is similar to her husband, and that my wife is very old. We even added a couple of people in, but she was very good at differentiating someone's aura.

Back to the tournament, team RWBY(BWRY) advanced all the way to finals and won. RWBY kicks everyone's asses, though Ruby has trouble dealing with a Mechatron power armor user in the final.

When interviewed, Ruby said she really wants one now, but thought Mechatron power armors are ugly.

I give her that.

Nobody apparently batted an eye to the use of power armor, to both of our confusion. Instead, the other royals(yes, they do have royals) complimented on Mechatron's products and asked how much would it cost to get a top of the line power armor for their daughters or sons. Being a very good business man, I offered an outrageous price for the best armors, which they accepted with no hesitation.

It's traditional to send their most senior to universities, and to send the rest to die(huntsmen academy or in the military), or else their children get married to no-name commoners and forced to secede their claim on the throne. It's a bargain with the non-democratic oligarchic governments, which they openly expressed their dislike and hatred.

Like the kingdoms back on Earth, they usually spend their time looking nice and pretty attending official state functions while the councils did the behind-the-work scenes.

The queen of Mantle even asked in a very round-bout way on how to take back her kingdom from those "damn Atlasian militants."

Later that evening, some even asked in a very round-bout way when my and I will have children.

Fuck that. It's more political bullshit. I got coached by Rin about how to say no, very nicely. She didn't want to deal with the implication of founding an independent movement or overthrowing any of the government either.

**Year 2, Day 144**

We finally got back from the festival.

Rin Furukawa told me that we should get married for real.

We got a 'marriage license', in which a lawyer backdate to the "founding" of Mechatron.

**Year 2, Day 156**

Tourism is booming now that we opened the underground to the public and that Chikyuu cultural media are being released slowly into the public domain.

**Year 2, Day 157**

The entertainment industry decided that my effort to release their heritage into the public domain constituted illegal monopolist behavior with a conspiracy to bankrupt their industry.

They decided to band together and sue me in all the kingdoms.

We hired more lawyers, again.

**Year 2, Day 160**

The ambassadors from the four kingdoms got together to negotiate something regarding the lawsuits with my prime minister and the department of state(Yeah, baby!).

**Year 2, Day 161**

My "business competitors" screamed bloody murder. We negotiated a trade treaty that gives the kingdom more tax revenue in exchange for scientists and engineers. In return, they will force the suits to drop all the lawsuits and will send their lawyers to fight any antitrust charges after five years. Sweet.

The lawsuits were not at all popular with the population, but they'll appreciate the extra burst of tax dollars.

I gave the business competitors the middle finger. I was so ready for prolonged protracted court battles.

**Year 2, Day 164**

A small spacecraft was launched into orbit, with significant thrusting capability. It then navigated to the large spaceship that was orbiting biter world.

Guess what? I cannot access the inside of the megarocket. It wouldn't let us in unless I am physically present.

I have to actually launch myself into orbit, which is dangerous, and then access the spacecraft.

That was a huge downer.

But once it know that a spacecraft of mine accessed the rocket, it started beaming down delicious information.

[LEVEL 2: BLUEPRINT UNLOCKED]

**Year 2, Day 175**

The level 2 blueprints weren't as awesome as I thought it was.

There's a lot of exotic science fiction technologies that I can't actually manufacture unless I have access to really rare materials or practically non-existent materials.

I don't have naquadah, trinium, and several dozens fictional alloys or metals.

My Level 2 machines are not as robust as level 1 due to the sheer complexity involved in engineering those.

**Year 2: Day 177**

I gathered together a few soldiers from my special operation regiment and told them to kit together a Stargate Command. We're going to explore.

**Year 2: Day 197**

Special Operation recovered missing-nins from Mist, and not canonical characters either.
