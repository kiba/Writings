# Chapter Twenty-nine: Exposed

The anthropologist/archaeologist Minori wandered to a maze, a place that almost nobody frequented.

Even asking the guards only yielded more questions. Why was the place built? According to them, it was a mandate. A mandate is the privilege of the nobility to demand the construction or the crafting of something, within reason. The king demanded this place be built, and so it was.

Why and how, Glen Black didn't particularly care at the moment. He just didn't want to get lost inside the maze. Using the inertial navigation feature of a pocket device he unsealed, he marked the way out.

"Why is this in English?" the archaeologist said out loud.

"Hmm?"

"I swore, the writing here is in English." Minori pointed to a set of runes.

That piqued his curiosity, more than anything else in the fortress. He wasn't good at English by any means, but he did study the writing and language in preparation for his duty, however good it did him.

"You're right," the huntsman said. "It is English."

"The birth of our great nation, the United States of America lies in the year....." she read out loud.

"I know what's that place is. It's the kingdom of Washington, the most powerful kingdom on Earth."

"You got it mixed up, Black. Washington DC is the capital of their nation. The kingdom's name is The United States of America."

"Then how come they're not-"

"You know Allothmy? It's the capital of the kingdom of Anthem. Five thousand years ago, even our nations aren't named after the capital. So, the question we should ask is why our kingdoms are named after our capital?"

Black sputtered a bit before answering, "damn if I know."

"Exactly."

The green hair woman turned back to the question. "I think we're supposed to punch in the answer using the keypad, but I am not exactly clear on Terran history trivia."

The woman scrolled down to another question.

"What the hell does that mean?" Black asked. "This place must have been built hundred years ago. Do you think someone from Earth might ended up on this planet somehow?"

Minori absently punched in the number for pi.

The floor slid away quickly, revealing a seemingly bottomless pit, dropping the two explorers.
