# Chapter Four: Breaching the Surface

The fanatical Human Liberation Front had destroyed Rin Furukawa's home with a powerful dust bomb on the moon, and plunged her forward five thousand years into the future.

Everyone she ever knew or ever care about is dead, and she hated the HLF for that. It was one thing to target designer humans like her, but they also condemned the entire planet to oblivion.

Of course, some of her people did survive, frozen in stasis chambers. They were strangers, either too old or too sick to come out. It's best not to disturb them. Furukawa wondered how many of them will be able to handle the future as it was now.

She would had committed suicide, if it wasn't a man in a certain suit of armor. A person who put up with her grief and her antics.

Before she knew it, that person's body was right next to her, in her own makeshift bed that she designed herself, stealing from sources like the inside of power armor for her fabrics.

Furukawa idly wondered if she had committed herself too early, when there are surely more fishes above the surface. Somehow, she didn't regret becoming a girlfriend to the man who awoke her up from a timeless slumber.

She see him breathing, his chest rising up and down. Then he slowly opened his eyes.

"Sweet dream?" she said.

"Not as good as last night's I am afraid. Of course, you also kept both of us up way past our bedtime."

Furukawa giggled a bit. "I don't regret it. It was a lot of fun."

"Of course, I don't either. But there will be time in the future where we aren't afforded such luxury," the man without a name said. Furukawa experimented with many names, none of which fit, but she loathed to call her boyfriend an "Engineer" as he insisted. Someday, she'll find a name just right for him.

"We aren't exactly in the hurry," Furukawa said. "The more machines the factory put out, the safer you feel, right?"

"We can't wait forever, love. There is a time limit before our bodies break down."

"That's a long way off."

"You're ready for this?"

Furukawa smiled. "I am ready to meet the world!"

His entire factory was ugly, in serious need of an industrial designer. There was no exception to his train network. They all looked like they are about to explode, but they never did, not even once. Somebody who engineered all of this knew what they were doing.

When she first came here, there was only one train, and it wasn't automated. Now, there's four trains, routing materials back and forth between the Chikyuu and this hub world, as her boyfriend called it.

He also installed razor walls across the entire length of the track toward the gate. Turrets then lined the outside of the walls, with lower walls to prevent biters from attacking the turrets. Deep ditches meant that his enemies would have to climb up to attack the turrets. Those ditches were mined as well.

Even the trains themselves have defensive capabilities installed. There was at least two wagons dedicated to only defense, and the locomotives itself has a turret installed on it.

"Hop on," the armored man said, gesturing to the locomotive that they were about to ride.

A name occurred to her. Ko CogWheel? No. Not a good name.

***

The couple arrived on Remnant, their train braking to a stop until they arrived at a station. Surrounding them was an armanda of turrets and ground vehicles, there to stop any potential alien invasion, and to stop enemy forces from getting to the gate. Their guns were all powered off.

Fortunately, her boyfriend was as paranoid about friendly fire as he was about his enemies.

They stepped off and proceed to the command center.

***

The command center was very roomy, enough to fit five floors, and it didn't have much, other than large screens to display everything they needed.

It has to be manageable by one person, given that there were no essentially manpower.

Her boyfriend sat in the control seat while Furukawa manned the only other console. He'll be in tactical command, given that he had refined the command and controls to his taste.

"Starting system diagnostics," she said. Everything was automated, she was there to keep a second eyes, making sure that he didn't get tunnel vision.

After a minute or so of running simulation and checks, everything was ready to go.

"Time to breach the surface!" he said.

***

A large TBM (Tunnel Boring Machine) cut away the earth at a shallow angle, automatically spraying flash concrete and pasting walls. Drones planted explosives and transceiver. Dirt fell to the bottom, carted away by a long snaking conveyor belts until it was dumped into a train wagon.

Then the TBM breached the surface. It bored through the forest that had grown on top of it. The heavyset machinery compacted the ground beneath them, crushing tree trumps until it was flat on the ground. Infantry units, modeled on the exoskeleton of power armors followed from behind.

There was no sign of anything resembling a city. Nothing at all resembling artificialness. If there was anything resembling a city, they would had reached its infrastructure even before reaching the surface.

"Don't assume anything, my dear," the commander said. "We barely explored the surface."

Forestry and construction machinery began emerging from the tunnel. There's a lot to clear away.

Then suddenly, black and white figures reached the views of the TBM.

"OH shit!" the commander said.

"What?" Furukawa wondered.

"It is as I fear, Rin. The Grimm controls the surface."

A band of beowolfs descended upon the boring machine, but not before the TBM deployed its guns.

Three set of rotating turrets popped out of their holes. They blazed away against the trees and the beowolves. The infantry, lacking much tactical intelligence, simply started shooting away as well.

Despite the tactical ineptness, the attacking Grimms simply melted away at the fire.

The boring machine reversed direction, retreating to the safety of the forward operating base that was being rapidly established.
