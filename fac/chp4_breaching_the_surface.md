# Chapter Four: Breaching the Surface

The terrorist organization Human Liberation Front, witha single dust bomb on the moon, destroyed Rin Furukawa's civilization in one apocalyptic denotation. In doing so, they extinguished the billion of lives that lived on Chikyuu and plunged Furukawa five thousand years into the future.

Everyone and everything she ever knew or ever cared about was dead and she hated the HLF for that. The death cult started out despising genetically engineered humans like Rin. She understood that hatred, but it went much further than that. They declared anyone who wasn't opposed to genetic engineering and dedicated to killing those 'infidel' as the enemy of mankind.

Was there anyone on the surface who continued to survive? She didn't know.

Of course, some of her people did survive. They were frozen in the stasis chambers just before the apocalypse. However, they were strangers, either too old or too sick to come out. If they ever come out, Furukawa wondered how many of them will be able to handle the future as it was now.

She would had committed suicide, if it wasn't a man in a certain suit of armor. A person who put up with her grief and her antics.

Before she knew it, that person's body was right next to her, in her own makeshift bed that she designed herself, having stolen fabrics and CAD models from other blueprints.

Furukawa idly wondered if she had committed herself too early, when there are surely more fishes above the surface. Some of her people have to survive in order to seed humanity again. Somehow, she didn't regret becoming a girlfriend to the man right next to her.n

She see him breathing, his chest rising up and down. Then he slowly opened his eyes.

"Sweet dream?" she asked.

"Not as good as last night's I am afraid. Of course, you also kept both of us up way past our bedtime."

Furukawa giggled a bit. "I don't regret it. It was a lot of fun."

"Of course, I don't either. But there will be time in the future where we aren't afforded such luxury," the man without a name said. Furukawa experimented with many names, none of which fit, but she loathed to call her boyfriend an "Engineer" as he insisted. Someday, she'll find a name just right for him.

"We aren't exactly in the hurry," Furukawa said. "The more machines the factory put out, the safer you feel, right?"

"We can't wait forever, love. There is a time limit before our bodies break down."

"That's a long way off."

"You're ready for this?"

Furukawa smiled. "I am ready to meet the world!"

His entire factory always looked like that it was on the edge of exploding. It hadn't so far. No exception was made for the trains. She was always of dying riding one of those trains. Whoever engineered those designs certainly knew what they were doing.

When she first came here, there was only one train, and it wasn't automated. Now, there's four trains, routing materials back and forth between Chikyuu and this hub world, as her boyfriend called it. Those train tracks were heavily defended and fortified. It was beyond ludicrous. There were entire rows of turrets, razor wires, two walls, ditches, mines, and so forth. When there's a new technology coming into play, it was an excuse for him to redesign the defensive perimeters.

Even the trains themselves have defensive capabilities installed. There was at least two wagons dedicated to only defense, and the locomotives itself has a turret installed on it.

"Hop on," the armored man said, gesturing to the locomotive that they were about to ride.

A name occurred to her. Ko CogWheel? No. Not a good name.

***

The couple arrived on Remnant, their train braking to a stop until they arrived at a station. As befitting of her lover's paranoia, there were also more turrets aimed at the train and the gate, but they were all turned off beforehand. Fortunately, her boyfriend was as equally paranoid about friendly fire as he was about his enemies.

They stepped off and proceed to the command center.

***

The command center was very roomy, enough to fit five floors, and it didn't have much, other than large screens to display everything they needed.

It has to be manageable by one person, given that there were no essentially manpower.

Her boyfriend sat in the control seat while Furukawa manned the only other console. He'll be in tactical command, given that he had refined the command and controls and learned how to use them properly.

"Starting system diagnostics," she said. Everything was automated, she was there to keep a second eyes, making sure that he didn't get tunnel vision.

After a minute or so of running simulation and checks, everything was ready to go.

"Time to breach the surface!" he said.

***

A large TBM (Tunnel Boring Machine) began boring away at the earth at a shallow angle, automatically spraying flash concrete and pasting concrete walls on the tunnel. Dirt were carried away through the machine's cutting surface, before falling to the bottom, carted away by a long snaking conveyor belts until it was dumped into a train wagon. Drones planted explosives and transceivers over the finished sections of the tunnel.


Once the machine breached the surface, it bored through the forest that had grown on top of it. The heavyset machinery compacted the ground beneath them, crushing tree trumps until it was flat on the ground. Infantry units, modeled on the exoskeleton of power armors followed from behind.

There was no sign of anything resembling a city. If there was such a city, they would had reached its infrastructure even before reaching the surface.

Forestry and construction machinery began emerging from the tunnel. There's a lot to clear away.

Then suddenly, black and white figures reached the views of the TBM.

"OH shit!" the commander said.

"What?" Furukawa wondered.

"Rin, the Grimm controls the surface."

A pack of beowolves descended upon the boring machine, but not before the TBM deployed its guns.

Three set of rotating turrets popped out of their holes, two from each side, and another on top. They blazed away against the trees and the beowolves. The infantry bots started shooting as well, not even bothering to take cover.

Despite the tactical ineptness, the attacking Grimms simply melted away at the fire.

The boring machine reversed direction, retreating to the safety of the forward operating base that was being rapidly established.
