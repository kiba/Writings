# Chapter Seven: A New Kingdom

**Day 168**

It turned out that the present day Remnans don't speak English at all to our horror, and Rin resorted to a practically dead language to communicate with Bartholomew Oobleck of all people.

Oh, and she didn't know the word for boyfriend, so she described me as her husband in that tongue.

Oops.

She also decided to take the regal option, despite my reservation. Another oops. We should had planned better.

I also had to hastily put down a warehouse and add all the stuff needed for a proper diplomatic meeting. We're a kingdom of only two people, but that's OK, because we got DAKKA.

The first contact party settled in while Rin did a lot of apologizing about the state of affair. Food and other supplies were brought in.

I noticed Qrow was very twitchy.

We also named our kingdom, "Mecha".

**Day 173**

I don't like it, but Rin can't do any research while she endlessly converse with Professor Oobleck. It's a very necessary job.

It turned out that Oobleck didn't know very much about the language either. Remnant as a whole really don't. So, it's a learning journey for both.

We got a whole knowledge base on this language, with children book. So that's what they're going through.

**Day 176**

The ruse is up. They discovered that we only are a kingdom of two. Uh oh. The military guys are still very nervous of our military capability, though.

Other delegation from other kingdoms arrive. More politics.

**Day 178**

The delegation from the four kingdom agreed to set up an embassies anyway. Oobleck, among others, will be staying on as a translator.

We were also gifted children's book on their languages. Joy!

Language learning is going to be a bitch, on top of all the other things we have to learn.

**Day 180**

We have a very nice dinner with Vale delegation before they left.

Before they left, they made it clear

**Day 182**

I haven't been idle on the logistic and production front.
