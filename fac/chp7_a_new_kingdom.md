# Chapter Seven: A New Kingdom

**Day 168**

It turned out that the present day Remnans don't speak English at all to our horror, and Rin resorted to a practically dead language to communicate with Bartholomew Oobleck of all people.

Oh, and she didn't know the word for boyfriend, so she described me as her husband in that tongue.

Oops.

She also decided to take the regal option, despite my reservation. Another oops. We should had planned better.

I also had to hastily put down a warehouse and add all the stuff needed for a proper diplomatic meeting. We're a kingdom of only two people, but that's OK, because we got DAKKA.

The first contact party settled in while Rin did a lot of apologizing about the state of affair. Food and other supplies were brought in.

I noticed Qrow was very twitchy.

We also named our kingdom, "Mechron".

**Day 173**

I don't like it, but Rin can't do any research while she endlessly converse with Professor Oobleck. It's a very necessary job.

It turned out that Oobleck didn't know very much about the language either. Remnant as a whole really don't. So, it's a learning journey for both.

We got a whole knowledge base on this language, with children book. So that's what they're going through.

**Day 176**

The ruse is up. They discovered that we only are a kingdom of two. Uh oh. The military guys are still very nervous of our military capability, though.

Other delegation from other kingdoms arrive. More politics.

**Day 178**

The delegation from the four kingdom agreed to set up an embassies anyway. Oobleck, among others, will be staying on as a translator.

We were also gifted children's book on their languages. Joy!

Language learning is going to be a bitch, on top of all the other things we have to learn.

**Day 180**

We have a very nice dinner with some of the delegations before they left.

Before they left, they made it clear that they're very nervous about the growing military might of Mechron and they would like to talk to us about it in the near future.

Screw them! I am not going to apologize for having war machines on a death world.

**Day 182**

I haven't been idle at all on the economy front, but not a whole lot of things are happening, with most of the work being done on boring old stuff.

Factories can run for a long time, but they're really stupid like a regular computer. Once you scale up your factory up to a certain degree, the amount of work skyrockets. The system isn't as perfect in factorio, where everything pretty much run forever with no maintenance. Stuff breaks, parts starts doing wrong things. It can be really dangerous. That's why I usually use drones to inspect my factory.

You can't really fix them one at a time, that would be too inefficient. You have to automatically fix them multiple times, but problems can be very insurmountable. I got no research staff. I need people.

Aside from my complaint, I am working on preparing to build a cross-continental train system. We're going to build rail tracks, and bastions every twenty kilometers, until we connect to Mistral and Vale. It's an ambitious project, and it required a lot of resources, and people.

We need people.

**Day 184**

A family of wolf faunus arrived. They wanted to settle in Bastion Alpha(Which we renamed to Allothmy in honor of the city). I say, let them!

Of course, it isn't as easy as it really seems.

We have no law, peace officers, or court beyond the gentleman agreement. Just two of us, and embassy staffs who choose to locate here.

Anyway, we took out half of the workday working out an onboarding process.
