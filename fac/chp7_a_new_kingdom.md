# Chapter Seven: A New Kingdom

**Day 168**

It turned out that the present day Remnans don't speak English at all to our horror, and Rin resorted to a practically dead language to communicate with Bartholomew Oobleck of all people.

Oh, and she didn't know the word for boyfriend, so she described me as her husband in that tongue.

Oops.

She also decided to take the regal option, despite my reservation. Another oops. We should had planned better.

I also had to hastily put down a warehouse and add all the stuff needed for a proper diplomatic meeting. We're a kingdom of only two people, but that's OK, because we got DAKKA.

The first contact party settled in while Rin did a lot of apologizing about the state of affair. Food and other supplies were brought in.

I noticed Qrow was very twitchy.

We also named our kingdom, "Mechron".

**Day 173**

I don't like it, but Rin can't do any research while she endlessly converse with Professor Oobleck. It's a very necessary job.

It turned out that Oobleck didn't know very much about the language either. Remnant as a whole really don't. So, it's a learning journey for both.

We got a whole knowledge base on this language, with children book. So that's what they're going through.

**Day 176**

The ruse is up. They discovered that we only are a kingdom of two. Uh oh. The military guys are still very nervous of our military capability, though.

Other delegation from other kingdoms arrive. More politics.

**Day 178**

The delegation from the four kingdom agreed to set up an embassies anyway. Oobleck, among others, will be staying on as a translator.

We were also gifted children's book on their languages. Joy!

Language learning is going to be a bitch, on top of all the other things we have to learn.

**Day 179**

Rin and I came into Dawson for trading. Professor Oobleck helped us with the trading, and we brought out several stores worth of inventory. The residents were speechless at our pocket dimension storage capability.

Anyway, Rin, ever mindful of domestic needs, brought out the entire clothes departments, furnitures, everything you need to make a human comfortable.

We are also now connected to the cross continental transmit system as a side effect of embassies being set up.

**Day 180**

We have a very nice dinner with some of the delegations before they left.

Before they left, they made it clear that they're very nervous about the growing military might of Mechron and they would like to talk to us about it in the near future.

Screw them! I am not going to apologize for having war machines on a death world.

**Day 182**

I haven't been idle at all on the economy front, but not a whole lot of things are happening, with most of the work being done on boring old stuff.

Factories can run for a long time, but they're really stupid like a regular computer. Once you scale up your factory up to a certain degree, the amount of work skyrockets because automation is not perfect. The system isn't as perfect in factorio, where everything pretty much run forever with no maintenance. Stuff breaks, parts starts doing wrong things. It can be really dangerous. That's why I usually use drones to inspect my factory.

You can't really fix them one at a time, that would be too inefficient. You have to automatically fix them multiple times, but problems can be very insurmountable. I got no research staff. I need people.

Aside from my complaint, I am working on preparing to build a cross-continental train system. We're going to build rail tracks, and bastions every twenty kilometers, until we connect to Vacuo and Vale. It's an ambitious project, and it required a lot of resources, and people.

We need people.

**Day 184**

A family of wolf faunus arrived. They wanted to settle in Bastion Alpha(Which we renamed to Allothmy in honor of the city). I say, let them!

Of course, it isn't as easy as it really seems.

We have no law, peace officers, or court beyond the gentleman agreement. Just two of us, and embassy staffs who choose to locate here.

Anyway, we took out half of the workday working out an onboarding process.

* Each person shall receive fifty square meters of living space. In case of family units, they are combined space.
* Each person shall receive a standard power armor suit, for their size.
* Each person shall receive rationing for their nutrition need.

We could add more, once we get factories going.

Once again, poor Rin is sidetracked with the onboarding process. We're figuring out as we go.

**Day 187**

Oh dear. Three families just shown up on our doorstep.

**Day 193**

I got the name of the wolf family. I know the male head of the family as Viole Lupus, and his wife as Skyler Lupus. Easy names to remember.

I found out that the settlers has a lot of general useful skills, so they're easy to adapt. What is hard to do is learn a very foreign language so that we can communicate with each other.

Anyway, I took Viole Lupus and taught him how to remote control drones and the new surrogate robotic platform. My eventual end goal is to have a factory manager.

His wife was already working with Rin on how to run a town.

**Day 196**

The delegation came back to discuss my war machines and my expansionist desire.

I stormed out of the meeting since they are whining and bitching about my growing military power.

SCREW THEM!

**Day 204**

Rin finally negotiated a deal with the four kingdoms. The continent we're on is divided into zone of influences. We have ours in the middle, and Vacuo and Vale have the other two.

They also really wanted a military arms limitation.

I called them traitors to humanity and all sort of names. Then I proceeded to rant about making more babies, robots, and factories if we're going to reclaim Rin's world from the Grimm.

The negotiation stopped there. Rin and I walked out.
