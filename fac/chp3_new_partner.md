# Chapter Three: New Partner

**Day 91**

Good news: I found a human! Her name is Rin Furukawa. I swore that's Japanese. She insisted that it's an English name, and she never heard of the Japanese before.

Whatever. It's complete utter bullshit.

I also made sure to give her power armor. I don't want her to die the moment she set into my world.

Bad news: Due to ethics and morals, I cannot savage the stasis chambers. There are people who are literally frozen in time who cannot be revived for various reasons.

**Day 92**

She continued to sprout theories about who the hell I am, which was amusing. What wasn't amusing is that she thought I might be an escaped criminal.

Anyway, Rin complained about the lack of housing, despite the fact that power armor IS housing, damn it. I can even sleep up-right, supported by my exoskeleton.

I gave in, built a warehouse, then I gave her a workstation, so she can learn and not get bored. I told her that I don't have any domestic blueprints. There's no chairs, bedding, or anything like that.

It's all strictly business, no creature comfort, unless you count the power armor.

**Day 93**

Archaeology aside, Rin and I agreed to bury the skeletons in a cemetery, but before I did that, I made sure to take lot of picture, and all sort of sensor reading, just in case.

But as we begun our makeshift ceremony to dedicate to the dead, Rin broke down in tears again.

It wasn't until hours later that she was able to stand for the ceremony.

To be clear, we are not about going to do a funeral for each of the dead, that would use up way too much time, but we felt that it was right to do at least this one.

**Day 94**

Rin invited me to her house, then she made me manufacture a few things that she designed, like tables, chairs, and bed.

It turned out that it was just a talk.

There, I learned the name of her world, Chikyuu, she called it, then I learned the name of her country, Anthem.

I swore that Chikyuu sounded Japanese, but she insisted very strongly that it was English.

Anyway, even though she doesn't believe my story(still big on the whole stasis escapee theory), she decided to humor me.

I told her the name of my planet and my nation's name. Funny enough, she thought America sound like [untranslatable], but I insisted that it was an English word. It went deeper from there, though I didn't tell much. It was mostly Rin's.

A terrorist group on Chikyuu's moon, Tsuki, exploded a powerful exotic bomb, throwing up a lot of materials, much of which fell into the planet. Some of those materials then react in the atmosphere, causing chain reactions, much of which was very bad for the biosphere.

The end result wasn't pretty.

There was no mention of the Grimm or Salem or the word Remnant. I assumed everything else come after the disaster.

**Day 99**

We got into a nasty argument and shouting match about breaching the surface. She strongly disagree and she doesn't believe in this whole nonsense about the Grimm.

Regardless of what she said, I will not breach the surface until I have overwhelming DAKKA.

**Day 101**

Rin still won't talk to me, but I was too busy with work. Lately, I been alternating between the Hub World and Remnant.

On the hub world, I work on building more war machines and designing new one, occasionally testing them by attacking biter nests. I added missile and anti-air trucks and radar buggy to my mix.

Most of my time went into programming and maintaining the production facility, with little in the way of expansion. I don't want to expand my pollution cloud too much.

On Remnant, most of my effort was spent on preserving as much as possible, with secondary effort to prevent rooms from collapsing.

Parallel to that effort, I also dug, building a reinforced shell around the underground system as well building my own underground. This is so that I can start doing actual industrial effort like mining, or preparing for breaching the surface. I also don't want to destroy the existing underground city if I can. If I am going to breach the surface, I am going to do it properly, with prepared turrets and defenses.

**Day 103**

Rin Furukawa apologized to me about my DAKKA requirement, but then she demanded that I come "home". She said that working until I fall asleep is unhealthy and that I could get killed.

Unfortunately, she was right.

I "moved" into the warehouse that was now more like a home.

She got a boatload of furnitures and things that she designed but I hadn't yet manufacture. I obliged.

**Day 104**

She spitted out water when I explained to her that none of the machinery as far as I know use dusts.

After confirming from her workstation that I was telling the truth, she then told me that it was outright IMPOSSIBLE.

After twenty minutes of ranting, she dove right into a workstation tutorial, relearning the basis of chemistry.

It also confirmed to me that her planet is really Remnant.

**Day 105**

It was mandatory, she said.

We went on a date. Mostly, she ordered me around to construct people-things, like benches, walkways, catwalk.

We also talked about a lot of things, mostly the difference in our culture, why do we name the things we do.

I thought I have lost my memories, but each unlock gave me back knowledge of my homeworld, though it never gave me memories of my personal life.

Why?

**Day 108**

What deed did I do to deserve this in my past life? Didn't she think that I am an escaped criminal?

We made love to each other.

**Day 112**

After careful digging and archaeology, I found a stasis chamber for a civilization kickstarter toolkit. The breadth and depth of the tools and supplies that were available was breathtaking. It includes all the major crops for this world, all the machine tools you can imagine, manual tools, nails, and so much more.

Rin believed that it was supposed to be used.

I agreed.

**Day 120**

I felt prepared. I put explosive on the breaching shaft, including two levels. I made sure to produce more than enough war machines to storm the surface in large numbers, as well construction units to start building defenses. I have enough heavy infantry(Rin engineered a model) to cover the floor as well.

Let's do this.
