# Chapter Three: New Partner

**Day 91**

Good news: I found a human! Her name is Rin Furukawa. I swore that's Japanese. She insisted that it's an English name, and she never heard of the Japanese before.

Whatever. It's complete utter bullshit.

I also made sure to give her power armor. I don't want her to die the moment she set into my world.

Bad news: Due to ethics and morals, I cannot savage the stasis chambers. There are people who are literally frozen in time who cannot be revived for various reasons.

**Day 92**

She continued to sprout theories about who the hell I am, which was amusing. What wasn't amusing is that she thought I might be an escaped criminal.

Anyway, Rin complained about the lack of housing, despite the fact that power armor IS housing, damn it. I can even sleep up-right, supported by my exoskeleton.

I gave in, built a warehouse, then I gave her a workstation, so she can learn and not get bored. I told her that I don't have any domestic blueprints. There's no chairs, bedding, or anything like that.

It's all strictly business, no creature comfort, unless you count the power armor.

**Day 93**

Archaeology aside, Rin and I agreed to bury the skeletons in a cementary, but before I did that, I made sure to take lot of picture, and all sort of sensor reading, just in case.

But as we begun our makeshift ceremony to dedicate to the dead, Rin broke down in tears again.

It wasn't until hours later that she was able to stand for the ceremony.

To be clear, we are not about going to do a funeral for each of the dead, that would use up way too much time.
