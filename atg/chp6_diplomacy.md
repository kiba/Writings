# Chapter Six: Diplomacy

***
**Diplomat Gerry Parkinson**
**Season One, Post-Episode Thirteen Season One**

The framers of the Constitution never guessed for the need to make treaties with powers from the stars, or its total secrecy, or that the senate wasn't going to vote on any of those treaties. That was largely up to the SGC's discretion. Those were swept under the rug under terms like "executive agreements" and other weasel terms.

Somehow it didn't feel all that egregious to diplomat Gerry Parkinson. He was also a participant in this himself, especially as he walked across a moon to meet with the leader of an amphibious species, the Ohnes.

Accompanying him was Doctor Daniel Jackson himself, who found himself a victim of a torturous misunderstanding. More importantly, Jackson was the leading expert on alien cultures. To many in the galaxy, he is the face of Earth, not the diplomatic corp. Thankfully, the doctor was a pretty good diplomat despite the lack of training.

"So, the Nem guy is the...," Parkinson tried to refresh his memory. "The guy who kidnapped you and almost killed you."

"That's right. He's going to be present to make his offer of reparation to me," Jackson answered.

"The guy with the fancy headdress, that's the king, right?"

"That's the best I can put it, yes."

They continued this conversation until they reached the meeting table.

Despite the fact that it was a first contact situation, this wasn't the first time that the Ohnes interacted with humanity. One of their own, Omoroca, helped foster a rebellion on Earth against the system lord Belus. Four thousand years later, Omoroca's mate, Nem faked Jackson's death.

Parkinson thought Doctor Jackson seemed all too readily to forgive Nem, but at least the torturer showed up.

"Hello, my name is Gerry Parkinson, a diplomat of the United States of America. I come here to negotiate an alliance with you against the Goa'uld."

**October 12, 1998**
**SGC, Stargate-Earth**

"One last chance to back out," Ambassador Faxon warned.

"I am good to go," Parkinson replied as the gate started its rotation.

"Good luck."

Ambassador Joesph Faxon would be going under any other circumstances, but there other concerns that made the ambassador a poor choice.

The ambassador was a character on Stargate SG-1, which may make persuasion more difficult than it would be otherwise, because Faxon was fictional to them. However, Gerry Parkinson was a complete non-entity in the series and he was experienced in off-world affairs. One of his achievement was having brokered a treaty with the Omoroca, the only advanced civilization to provide Earth with technical help until the alliance with the Tok'ra was formalized. One last consideration was that Gerry Parkinson was that his double was working in the state department doing the same exact job.

"The iris is open," Harriman said after the gate connected. "Confirming with rover." The rover made it through intact on the other side.

Parkinson fearlessly walked through the gate's horizon, ending up in a hot warehouse with no air conditioning. He could see SGC personnels sweating profusely. There was no movie set for the show, as the gate was moved days earlier.

It was a precaution to separate the billionaire from a possible investigation and public exposure of the stargate to the public.

"Follow me," a CIA agent said after the diplomat walked through.

Parkinson got in a car with the CIA. Then he was dropped in town. From there, Parkinson made the first of many calls for taxi. He trained for this back on his Earth, zip-zagging across a state to ensure that he couldn't be traced back so easily.

Some hours later, he was already in his fourth ride. Parkinson saw the future, and the future didn't seem to be a foreign country. Looking out the window doesn't seem to suggest much change at all. He knew that gay marriage was judged constitutional by the court, and there was a black president in charge, but those changes can be seen miles away in nineteen ninety-eight. Some conservatives might be aghast, but one might argue that's inevitable progress.

Nonetheless, it will still be a strange experience.

**October 14, 2015**

After many rides and a motel stay, Parkinson finally arrived at his intended designation, a military base.

Despite being a diplomat from an alternate reality, Parkinson started to feel like a crackpot as he approached a military installation.

A bored soldier jolted into alertness at the sight of Parkinson carrying a suitcase; the diplomat having walked up to the checkpoint, rather than use a car.

"I am Gerry Parkinson with the state department. I need to speak with the base commander as soon as possible."

"Can I see your identification please?" the soldier asked.

Parkinson obliged, giving him his nineteen ninety-eight documentations.

"Excuse me? Do you have anything more recent than this? Any other form of identification."

"No."

The soldier phoned the base headquarter. "Do we have a Gerry Parkinson meeting with the commander? Huh uh. No? OK."

Then the soldier turned his attention to the diplomat. "You don't have an appointment with the commander."

"Yes, um, this is an emergency. I am with the state department."

The diplomat waited for twenty minutes as the soldier did his research with google as well talked to his superior. He finally announced, "sir, you are under arrest for imitation of a government official. You have the right to remain silent. Anything that you say could be used against you in the court of law."

Finally.

Parkinson turned around for easy access to the handcuffs. "I can explain all of this, but it will be hard to believe," he said, giving up his fifth amendment right.

"Sure," the soldier said incredulously. "But Gerry Parkinson is stationed in China, having just talked to a Chinese official. Unless our diplomat can teleport."

Of course, this was how it was going to end. He hoped to get to the base commander and then to the POTUS of two thousand fifteen, but the security guard proved too vigilant and competent. Parkinson was actually fine with that, proud even, but he was annoyed that he cannot do his job so easily.

**Hours later**

Parkinson had just deliberately put himself in a situations that he wouldn't want to be in. Still there was something comforting in that the interrogation room looked more like an office, rather than a place to question suspects.

The door opened up to a man and a woman. The smell of food waffled over the diplomat's nose.

"I am special agent Daniel Fox and this is special agent Madison Smith," the male FBI agent introduced himself before the both of them sat down opposite of the diplomat. "Would you like a hot dog and a coke as you answer our questions?"

"No," the diplomat said.

"That's alright. How about we start with your name? Your real name."

"The only name I ever have in my life is Gerry Parkinson."

"That's the name of the diplomat you tried to impersonate earlier. This is a federal crime. Come clean now, and your cooperation will be noted in your sentencing."

"Who says that I cannot have the same name as him, or have the same job as him?"

"There are no other Gerry Parkinson in the state department."

"Did you take a look at my suitcase? The classified documents?"

"They are obvious fake," special agent Smith said flatly. Parkinson could already feel the anger and frustration rising in him. The FBI agents had already concocted a story before even meeting him.

"You didn't even check the materials for authenticity?"

"We already know that you are a fraud," agent Fox said. Parkinson twitched at that.

"In that case, I don't think it will be too much time to check that I am not another Snowden, hmm?"

The FBI agents turned their face to each other. A series of facial expression occurred, communicating what to do without uttering a single word.

"Ahem. We'll check for the authenticity, but if they're real, I guarantee you that it will be much worse for you. Theft of classified information is a much more serious crime than impersonating a government official."

"I am well aware of that. However, I neither stole information or impersonated anyone. I am authorized on the behalf of my government to open negotiation and contact with this government."

"Excuse me?"

"You wouldn't believe me, but I am from an alternate reality."

Fox laughed for a moment and then turned serious again. His face of contempt staring down at Parkinson. "Bullshit."

**Air Base Commander William Wellford**

Air Base Commander William Wellford sighed. It wasn't everyday that you have a man in suit showing up at a gate, and getting caught for impersonation of a government official. What for? He literally had no clues.

That's why he called in the FBI to deal with it after confirming that the impersonator has no bombs or weapons. The fed arrived, put the evidence in plastic bag, and now they wanted to see him.

"Do you have anything on this man?" he asked.

"Not yet," agent Fox answered. "This man refused to give out his real name or his motive. He fed us science fiction stories, but he told us that there were classified document in the suitcase. That's where you come in. Tell us if it has any authenticity."

The agent opened up the suitcase to revealed a cartload of documents, all marked top-secret. Wellford examined it, and it didn't take long for him to come to a conclusion.

"I should put it back," the commander said. "It's real to my eyes, but it's almost two decade old."

"Are we..."

"I don't know if it's authentic without further verification, but I can see that it's not for my eyes only."

"So, we might not be dealing with just any crank, but a crank in possession of national secrets, or a man who happens to be very good at faking documents."

"It's shaping up to be an interesting case."

"At least he was dumb enough to fall right into ourlap."

**FBI Special Agent Ben Brown**

Somebody shown up in the state of Nevada and started impersonating a diplomat. Strangely, he was good at it too, giving out too detailed description of a diplomat's personal life. Well, agent Ben Brown was there at the diplomat's house, to find how the criminal pilfered personal information. He came prepared with a truck full of equipment for hunting bugging devices and horde of agents.

It was a huge mansion, with well manicured lawns in a middle class neighborhood that was about to become the scene of a crime.

He knocked on the door and rang the doorbell. It only took a moment for the door to answer.

"Hello," the diplomat's wife greeted.

"I am special agent Ben Brown with the FBI. We have a search warrant for your house. We have reasons to believe that your house might be bugged..."

The woman looked absolutely shocked. "Is it because of....the Chinese?" she wondered.

"Ma'am, we don't know for sure, yet."

"Can you explain what's going on?" Mrs. Parkinson queried.

"Ma'am, somebody's impersonating your husband. He also knew in imitate details about your life in too much details. Details that your husband confirmed as true. We suspected that you were being spied upon."

"Can you show me what he look like?"

The agent showed the picture of the man.

"That's...my husband!"

"I am sorry?"

"Hold on, let me get my photobook."

Sure enough, the man eerily resembled the photo.

"Are you sure that this is what your husband look like?"

"Uh huh. We took that photo seventeen years ago."

It took hours for the team to comb every inch of the diplomat's house, but in the end, they found absolutely nothing. There were no bugs in the house.

He even got the wife to ask very personal questions to the impersonator that only her husband and her would know. If it was anything more than seventeen years ago, this man knew, but past that? He didn't know a thing.

What was that supposed to mean?

***
**FBI Agent Daniel Fox**

He thought that this man in the interrogation room was a simple crank, another easy case. Yet, he found nothing useful.

The DNA profiles didn't find anything, neither did his fingerprints. The FBI database was very comprehensive, but people who had never committed a crime yet was very unlikely to be in the database. It might be that this criminal was a first-time offender.

The man never quite bulge in the story either, except for one momentarily lapse.

"So why did you lie about bugging the diplomat's wife?" Fox asked.

The fake diplomat snorted, then he became visibly angry. "What are you going to think what's going to happen? I am saying the truth all alone, then you believed my lie in my moment of weakness."

"Weakness?"

"Yes, weakness. Eventually, I'll just tell you the story that you wanted to hear, because I am tired, hungry, and sick of your incessant questioning." Then the fake diplomat stood up abruptly. "I did not want my wife's privacy violated!"

"If you stopped compulsively lying and tell me the truth, then none of this would had happened."

"I. AM. NOT. LYING!"

"Alright then. What would you have me do to disprove or prove your story?"

The fake diplomat smiled. "Take my DNA and compare it to your diplomat. It'll be the same."

Fox sneered at that obvious lie. "I'll have to get the diplomat's permission, then."
