**Diplomat Gerry Parkinson**
**Season One, Post-Episode Thirteen Season One**


The framers of the Constitution would had never guessed for the need to make treaties with powers in the stars, or its total secrecy, or the fact that the senate wasn't going to vote on any of those treaties. That was largely up to the SGC's discretion. Those were swept under the rug under terms like "executive agreements" and other weasel terms.

Somehow that didn't feel all that egregious to diplomat Gerry Parkinson. For sure, he was a participant in this himself, especially as he walked across a moon to meet with the leader of an amphibious species, the Ohnes.

Accompanying him was Doctor Daniel Jackson himself, who was a diplomat himself, despite or rather because of his training.

"You do the translation and I do the talking, correct?" Parkinson said. "Then we discuss the demand together."

Despite the fact that it was a first contact situation, this wasn't the first time that the Ohnes interacted with humanity. One of their own, Omoroca, helped foster a rebellion on Earth against the system lord Belus. Four thousand years later, Omoroca's mate, Nem, interrogated and almost killed Doctor Daniel Jackson.

Ambassador Joesph Faxon was a fictional character to the alternate reality United States. However, Parkinson wasn't a character in "Stargate SG-1" or any other franchise. That was a huge factor in selection, because it was less likely that they would reject him as a fraud, scammer, or a crackpot.

Another important consideration was the fact that Gerry Parkinson existed in the other reality, seventeen years older, doing Parkinson's job.

Of course, Parkinson also has experience in dealing with otherworldly civilizations or culture, from Abydos to the Ohnes, and even to the Nox.

The alternate reality United States wasn't foreign at all. Gay marriage was approved, and there was a black president, but those changes can be seen miles away in nineteen ninety-eight. The conservatives might be aghast, but it was clear that the clock cannot be turned back.

Nonetheless, it was going to be a strange experience, and Parkinson has that in spades.

Despite being a diplomat from an alternate reality, Parkinson started to feel like a crackpot as a he approached a military installation.

A bored soldier jolted into alertness as the sight of a man in suit carrying a briefcase approached the security checkpoint.

This man wasn't in a car at all.

"I am Gerry Parkinson with the state department. I need to speak to the president as soon as possible, please."

"I am sorry, what?"

"Please get your commander and don't speak to anyone."

The diplomat ended up being arrested.

Parkinson had just deliberately put himself in a situations that he wouldn't want to be in. The interrogation room looked more like an office, rather than a place to question suspects.
