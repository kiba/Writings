# Chapter Four: Welcome to the Future

**John Swift**
**Infopunk-Earth**

As John Swift stood in front of the stargate, Swift was still searching in his mind for answers to the reality he was currently facing. He talked to psychologists to test his sanity, and he even tried to find the man who sold him the gate. His search for answers had only beget more questions.

Either he was hallucinating vividly or that he was really witnessing reality. For now he decided that it was the later rather than the former.

Swift made a commitment some time ago to help the formerly fictional SGC with meeting with his government. To be able to do that, he announced that he was taking a sudden and long vacation. It wasn't something to be taken lightly, but it wasn't hard either. It was like a childhood dream come true. Recently, the SGC requested for a place to stay and set up operation. Swift obliged.

Swift took a look at his phone. It was eight AM sharp. Then the gate's inner ring started moving. There's going to be a gate connection.

Colonel Frank Cromwell emerged from the pool-like portal, the energy field collapsing right behind him. He was dressed in his Battle Dress Uniform(BDU), pulling a wheeled luggage.

"Good to have you back, Colonel," Swift greeted.

"Good to see you as well, Mr. Swift," Cromwell replied back. "Where Sinclair?"

"Probably working at a cafe writing his novel. I already have a place for you to stay at. I'll be driving you there." It was Swift's house. Given the lack of identity and history, there's not a whole of places where they could stay at.

"No butler?"

"Sorry, I am not that kind of person."

When they were were finally at the parking lot, Swift's car's frunk opened up.

"Is this some alternate universe where people put the car engine in the back?" Cromwell asked.

Swift laughed in bemusement. "No, it's nothing like that. With an electric car, our 'engines' are the motors that sat next to each wheel. So there's no need for big engine blocks. That opened up both the back and front for space."

"Oh."

"And the vast majority of cars today on the road are still the cars that you are used. They each have an internal combustion engine inside and use gasoline, but I don't believe that will be the future."

"Because of cars like this?"

"No. It's due to the stargate program. Room temperature superconductors? Antigravity? FTL travel? That's going to change automotive technology if we don't already start teleporting everywhere. It's going to be revolutionary."

The men got inside the car, with Swift taking the driver seat, while Cromwell took the front passenger seat.

Swift could see the colonel scanning everything within the car, paying attention to all the newness that were never present in the car.

"Where the gearstick?"

Swift realized suddenly that his car didn't have a gearstick.

**Colonel Frank Cromwell**

So this was where he will be staying for the foreseeable future. For Swift's wealth, the house was rather modest. It was a standard fare typical three bedroom suburban home.

As he walked toward a guestroom he will be staying in, he realized how the future didn't really change much. There were new and different cars, of course, but they still pollute and consume fossil fuel all the same. Even Swift's car, which ran on electricity wasn't all that different.

Technology had clearly advanced, but it hasn't morphed into unrecognizable form.

For Cromwell, it was also clear that the bedroom still looked and functioned the same as it did in nineteen ninety-eight. There were the closet, dresser, drawers and the mattress. If there were any technological changes for the past seventeen years, it was unnoticeable.

When he arrived in the living room, there was a pizzabox on the coffee table, a sign that he was still in America, if in a different dimension altogether.
