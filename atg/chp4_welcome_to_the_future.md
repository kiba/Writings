# Chapter Four: Welcome to the Future

**John Swift**

As John Swift stood in front of the stargate, Swift was still searching in his mind for answers to the reality he was currently facing. He talked to psychologists to test his sanity, and he even tried to find the man who sold him the gate. There were only more questions.

He was hallucinating vividly, out of his complete mind, or he was really witnessing all but the impossibility. Even the delusion was agreeing with him.

Colonel Frank Cromwell emerged from the pool-like portal, the energy field collapsing right behind him. He was dressed in his Battle Dress Uniform(BDU), pulling a wheeled luggage.

"Good to have you back, Colonel," Swift greeted.

"Good to see you as well, Mr. Swift," Cromwell replied back. "Where Sinclair?"

"Probably working at a cafe writing his novel. I already have a place for you to stay at. I'll be driving you there."

"No butler?"

"Sorry, I am not that kind of person."
