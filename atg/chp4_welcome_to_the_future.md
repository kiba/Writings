# Chapter Four: Welcome to the Future

***
**John Swift**
**Infopunk-Earth**
**September 22, 2015**

As the billionaire stood in front of the stargate, Swift was still searching in his mind for answers to the reality he was currently facing. He talked to psychologists to test his sanity, and he even tried to find the man who sold him the gate. His search for answers had only beget more questions.

Either he was hallucinating vividly or that he was really witnessing reality. Somehow, he felt that the later must be the truth, however improbable it was.

Swift made a commitment some time ago to help the formerly fictional SGC with meeting with his government, forgoing any publicity and trusting that secrecy was the best approach. To be able to do that, he announced that he was taking a sudden and long vacation. Helping out the SGC wasn't something to be taken lightly at all, but it wasn't hard either. It was more like a childhood dream come true, a fulfillment of a fantasy, even though it has became a burden and a responsibility.


Even as a billionaire, he enlisted himself to teaching them the necessary knowledge needed to navigate a modern mac computer, and how to use the internet safely and use google. There was no one else to do it. John Swift or Vincent Sinclair wasn't much of a choice at all, but they rather not let anyone else on the planet know of their existence.

So when the SGC requested for a place to stay and set up operation, Swift quickly obliged.

Swift took a look at his phone. It was eight AM sharp. Then the gate's inner ring started moving. There's going to be a gate connection.

Colonel Frank Cromwell emerged from the pool-like portal, the energy field collapsing right behind him. He was dressed in his Battle Dress Uniform(BDU), pulling a wheeled luggage.

"Good to have you back, Colonel," Swift greeted.

"Good to see you as well, Mr. Swift," Cromwell replied back. "Where Sinclair?"

"Probably working at a cafe writing his novel. I already have a place for you to stay at. I'll be driving you there." It was Swift's house. The Colonel lacked proper identification, let alone currencies. There was no other places that he could stay at.

"No butler?"

"Sorry, I am not that kind of person."

When they were were finally at the parking lot, Swift's car's frunk opened up.

"Is this some alternate universe where people put the car engine in the back?" Cromwell asked.

Swift laughed in bemusement. "No, it's nothing like that. With an electric car, our 'engines' are the motors that sat next to each wheel. So there's no need for big engine blocks. We still have a trunk, but the front is now open space as well."

"Oh."

"And the vast majority of cars today on the road are what you are used to. They each have an internal combustion engine inside and use gasoline, but I don't believe that will be the future."

"Because of cars like this?"

"No. It's due to the stargate program. Room temperature superconductors? Antigravity? FTL travel? That's going to change automotive technology if we don't already start teleporting everywhere. It's going to be revolutionary."

The men got inside the car, with Swift taking the driver seat, while Cromwell took the front passenger seat.

Swift could see the colonel scanning everything within the car, paying attention to the differences.

"Where the gearstick?"

Swift realized suddenly that his car didn't have a gearstick.

So this was where he will be staying for the foreseeable future. For Swift's wealth, the house was rather modest. It was a standard fare typical three bedroom suburban home.

As he settled in a questroom, he realized how much the future changed. There were new models of cars, of course, but they still pollute and consume fossil fuel all the same. Even Swift's electric car seemed more of a refinement than a revolution.

Technology had clearly advanced, but it hasn't morphed into completely unrecognizable form.

The bedroom still looked and functioned the same as it did in nineteen ninety-eight. There were the closet, dresser, drawers and the mattress, pillows, and so on. He wondered if there were some new type of fabric, or a new type of paint, or some other technological changes that's too subtle.

When he arrived in the living room, there was a pizza box on the coffee table, a sign that he was still in America, if in a different dimension altogether.

There were also cardboards and packages strewn around, and new laptops.

"I know you guys asked for the ability to purchase stuff through me," Swift said. "For now, you'll have fifty-thousand dollars limit on what you can purchase, but no rifles or weapons or anything like that. I will be invoicing the expense incurred by ordering using my account to your government. Mainly, it won't be dollars per dollars exchange, but access to your world and the ability to spend some money there."

"You're downright cheap," Cromwell recalled. "At least compared to government contractors."

"My time is expensive," Swift said. "There are thousands of other things that I could be doing right now, but the survival of Earth come first, yeah? Anyway, I do want your money, but it's going to be in the form of a corporation formed on both side, that's going to understand that the survival of humanity is at stake."

**General George Hammond**
**SGC, SG-Earth**
**September 24, 1998**

If anything that made Stargate Command unique, it was the fact that the organization was responsible for everything from basic science research, archaeological digs, cultural outreach, espionage and sabotage, direct strike missions, and diplomatic mission.

There was no way that General George Hammond could manage this alone. He didn't have the skillset nor wanted to handle such a dizzyingly array of concerns. That meant delegation. Carter and Jackson both respectively head their own scientific department, while O'Neill handles military training and oversee special operation teams assigned here.

Some delegation were ordered from the higher ups. One of them, CIA Station Chief Andrew Brewster was meeting with him today in his office. Hammond didn't so much give orders, but cooperate with the chief on intelligence matters, but mostly left him to his own device to manage SGC's growing spy network.

"I trust that you have no problem with the deal I made with the billionaire John Swift?" Hammond questioned.

"No, general," Brewster said. "As you rightfully pointed out, we have no choice but to trust him to keep the stargate a secret from the public. If he can keep his end of the bargain, we'll create a false identity for him. Of course we'll have the full weight of the law on him once he's on this side."

"If he's not playing a long-con with us and that any punishment we may exact him doesn't scare him."

"There's a risk that he will reveal the secrets if we don't keep our end of the bargain."

"Then as far as we're concerned, we're done with him."

"We'll still need to monitor this man's disposition to see how they change, but that's it."

"Let's move on to the next topic. I asked you to provide a plan on how to contact his government."

The greying man cleared out his throat, before handling him the folder. "I believe this will be mostly a diplomatic operation, rather than an intelligence one, but it still require our expertise in planning covert operation. The overall plan is as followed, our diplomatic envoy will deliver himself to a military base, which will get him arrested. In a briefcase are all select classified materials that will prove our story. The envoy himself with a double of the one that existed on their Earth."

"By classified materials? If they don't believe it, then something might happen that the materials will be released to the public."

"It's a calculated risk. My analysts will select materials that will be of interest to that government yet not pose a dangerous threat to national security if exposed. The president will be giving his own take. If it's a GO, then we'll execute the plan."

"I understand. When will I expect this to be done?"

"Three weeks is the deadline. "

**Colonel Frank Cromwell**
**Hawthorne, Infopunk-Earth**
**September 25, 2015**

The future wasn't only defined by what's there, but also what's missing. A common form of reference between nineteen ninety-eight and two thousand fifteen was the television. The device was much flatter, while providing greater clarity and resolution. However, the biggest change was the programming. The owner of the house declined to get any cable at all, instead subscribing to services like 'youtube' and 'netflix'.

Another change that Cromwell didn't expect was the disappearance of the landline. His host told him, that like cable, it was outdated. Instead, everyone carried 'smartphones', a mobile general purpose computing device that happened to be a phone.

Only later, Cromwell understood that not everyone cut out cable or their landline, but it was steadfastly becoming the case.

With 'limited' entertainment option, eventually turned to the the glowing screen of a newly purchased laptop and its connection to the internet. The internet of the future was far more captivating and rich than what was available in nineteen ninety-eight. In his downtime, he browsed the web like a zombie, subsisting on various media.

Yet, there were some aspects that still mystified the airman. "What do people use?" he would say. The billionaire would supply a number of things that young people use that Swift himself cared not to use. To be honest, he didn't care about twitter or facebook either.

The colonel didn't know how to think about this. Here was a man who reveled in 'living in the future' and 'forcefully creating the future', yet he completely failed to adopt certain technologies. Swift was a technophile until he wasn't. Maybe the technologist was stuck in past vision of the future?

Whatever the case may be, he didn't come here to subsist on Swift's charity. It wasn't in the Colonel's nature to be completely useless or lazy, even if has to fly a desk. Luckily, SGC supplied him some homework. Doctor Jackson saw fit to provide a daily questionnaire and language worksheets from his department. O'Neill wanted him to buy and read books about the wars that this country's military had campaigned in since ninety-eight. Carter did tried to give him homework, but it became quickly clear that Cromwell wasn't well versed in that field, so it was dropped. Ditto for the medical department.

That led him to spending countless hours on the laptop in Swift's dining room, reading and writing answers questions in word document, encrypting it, and saving it on a usb drive. Swift made it clear that there were surveillance on online email account, if not necessary by his own government, but certainly by corporations.

A light flickered on. The billionaire was present, dressed in a business suit, looking a bit tired.

"How's today, Colonel?" Swift asked.

"Business as usual," the Colonel said. "Flying a desk is not my idea of 'fun'. I spent my career in special operation, in the field. At least the questions were intellectually interesting."

"You have been reading about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan," Swift noted.

"It provided useful insight on how to conduct asymmetrical warfare. We cannot hope to stand up to the Goa'uld in a straight fight."

"No starship enterprise?"

"Oh, we'll still build starships, but we have to be realistic about confronting something much bigger than us. It's David versus Goliath."

"Isn't that how we won the war against the Goa'uld in the series?"

"I am not inclined to use fiction as evidence, Mr. Swift, even ignoring the cases of deus ex machina being used repeatedly to solve problems."

"I heard your SG-1 is a bit like the series' SG-1."

The colonel chuckled. "It's certainly the legendary team. But they're nowhere as unprofessional or as heroic as in the show. In our line of business, we considered 'heroic' bad. How many time do you want to risk Earth almost dying before saving the day?"

"Aren't you the guy who got sucked in by a blackhole?"

"See why 'heroic' are bad? You might get a really shiny medal for your effort, but it's likely that you will also end up in the ground."

"Will you get one?"

There was a pause before Cromwell answered. "I never thought about it until now, but I am not going to lie to you. I like to be acknowledged for what I accomplished. Who wouldn't? However, I am not going to let anything like that gets to my head. My reward is an Earth that's still not swallowed by a blackhole, and all the people on it. Will I get one? Probably, but not before SG-1."
