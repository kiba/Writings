# Chapter Four: Welcome to the Future

***
**John Swift**
**Infopunk-Earth**

As John Swift stood in front of the stargate, Swift was still searching in his mind for answers to the reality he was currently facing. He talked to psychologists to test his sanity, and he even tried to find the man who sold him the gate. His search for answers had only beget more questions.

Either he was hallucinating vividly or that he was really witnessing reality. For now he decided that it was the later rather than the former.

Swift made a commitment some time ago to help the formerly fictional SGC with meeting with his government. To be able to do that, he announced that he was taking a sudden and long vacation. It wasn't something to be taken lightly, but it wasn't hard either. It was like a childhood dream come true. Recently, the SGC requested for a place to stay and set up operation. Swift obliged.

Swift took a look at his phone. It was eight AM sharp. Then the gate's inner ring started moving. There's going to be a gate connection.

Colonel Frank Cromwell emerged from the pool-like portal, the energy field collapsing right behind him. He was dressed in his Battle Dress Uniform(BDU), pulling a wheeled luggage.

"Good to have you back, Colonel," Swift greeted.

"Good to see you as well, Mr. Swift," Cromwell replied back. "Where Sinclair?"

"Probably working at a cafe writing his novel. I already have a place for you to stay at. I'll be driving you there." It was Swift's house. Given the lack of identity and history, there's not a whole of places where they could stay at.

"No butler?"

"Sorry, I am not that kind of person."

When they were were finally at the parking lot, Swift's car's frunk opened up.

"Is this some alternate universe where people put the car engine in the back?" Cromwell asked.

Swift laughed in bemusement. "No, it's nothing like that. With an electric car, our 'engines' are the motors that sat next to each wheel. So there's no need for big engine blocks. That opened up both the back and front for space."

"Oh."

"And the vast majority of cars today on the road are still the cars that you are used. They each have an internal combustion engine inside and use gasoline, but I don't believe that will be the future."

"Because of cars like this?"

"No. It's due to the stargate program. Room temperature superconductors? Antigravity? FTL travel? That's going to change automotive technology if we don't already start teleporting everywhere. It's going to be revolutionary."

The men got inside the car, with Swift taking the driver seat, while Cromwell took the front passenger seat.

Swift could see the colonel scanning everything within the car, paying attention to all the newness that were never present in the car.

"Where the gearstick?"

Swift realized suddenly that his car didn't have a gearstick.

**Colonel Frank Cromwell**

So this was where he will be staying for the foreseeable future. For Swift's wealth, the house was rather modest. It was a standard fare typical three bedroom suburban home.

As he walked toward a guestroom he will be staying in, he realized how the future didn't really change much. There were new and different cars, of course, but they still pollute and consume fossil fuel all the same. Even Swift's car, which ran on electricity wasn't all that different.

Technology had clearly advanced, but it hasn't morphed into unrecognizable form.

For Cromwell, it was also clear that the bedroom still looked and functioned the same as it did in nineteen ninety-eight. There were the closet, dresser, drawers and the mattress, pillows, and so on. If there were any technological changes for the past seventeen years, it was unnoticeable.

When he arrived in the living room, there was a pizzabox on the coffee table, a sign that he was still in America, if in a different dimension altogether.

There were also cardboards and packages strewn around, and new laptops.

"I know you guys asked for the ability to purchase stuff through me," Swift said. "For now, you'll have fifty-thousand dollars limit on what you can purchase, but no rifles or weapons or anything like that. I will be invoicing the expense incurred by ordering using my account to your government. Mainly, it won't be dollars per dollars exchange, but access to your world and the ability to spend some money there."

"I already understood that you negotiated with my government like a good capitalist for consulting fee," Cromwell said. "Thankfully, it was not exorbitant compared to defense contractors. You're downright cheap."

"Naturally, I expect some compensation," Swift said. "My time is expensive, but, I am not going to sucker every dimes and pennies to make a quick buck. I have enough of bullshit. I don't think I need to skewer the SGC for more of their precious resources. Now, let me get this show on the road and show you how to purchase things on the internet."

**General Hammond**
**SGC, SG-Earth**

It was easy to satisfy John Swift's requirement. There was already a process for creating identities for aliens which was in turn ripped from the US marshall's witness protection program. Creating a new one for John Swift was completely identical.

The CIA officer who was meeting with him was not the slightest amused.

"General, I thought we were already constraining the amount of aliens who are allowed access to outside of this base," Kerry Johnson, the CIA liaison to Stargate Command said.

"I assured you that it was done in the view that gaining access to his government would be extremely valuable. He seemed willing to cooperate with us."

"Couldn't you just give him gold and precious metals to gain his cooperation?"

"He had an argument against that one. Gold is not valuable when they will be common in the future. If anything, he wanted naquadah and trinium. Naturally of course, I said no."

Johnson frown. "This alien-"

"An American," Hammond insisted. "He is as American as you and I."

"He may be one of us, General, but not all Americans can be trusted to withhold the secrecy of the stargate program."

"In that case, we have no choice but to trust him on his honor. If he didn't leak anything or talk to anyone outside of his government, than we have reason to believe that we could give him what he want, access to our reality, under the full penalty of the law of course."

"I think that discussion is over, though I disagree with your assessment. Let's move on. My superior agreed that we should be communicating with Swift's government. This will not be a CIA operation by any means, but we will provide support to the diplomatic corp, who had been preparing for all this time. There will need for research on the currency political environment..."
