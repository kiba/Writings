# Chapter Four: Welcome to the Future

**John Swift**

As John Swift stood in front of the stargate, Swift was still searching in his mind for answers to the reality he was currently facing. He talked to psychologists to test his sanity, and he even tried to find the man who sold him the gate. His search for answers had only beget more questions.

Either he was hallucinating vividly or that he was really witnessing reality.

Colonel Frank Cromwell emerged from the pool-like portal, the energy field collapsing right behind him. He was dressed in his Battle Dress Uniform(BDU), pulling a wheeled luggage.

"Good to have you back, Colonel," Swift greeted.

"Good to see you as well, Mr. Swift," Cromwell replied back. "Where Sinclair?"

"Probably working at a cafe writing his novel. I already have a place for you to stay at. I'll be driving you there."

"No butler?"

"Sorry, I am not that kind of person."

When they were were finally at the parking lot, Swift's car's frunk opened up.

"Is this some alternate universe where people put the car engine in the back?" Cromwell asked.

Swift laughed in bemusement. "No, it's nothing like that. With an electric car, our 'engines' are the motors that sat next to each wheel. So there's no need for big engine blocks. That opened up both the back and front for space."

"Oh."

"And the vast majority of cars today on the road are still the cars that you are used. They each have an internal combustion engine inside and use gasoline, but I don't believe that will be the future."

"Because of cars like this?"

"No. It's due to the stargate program. Room temperature superconductors? Antigravity? FTL travel? That's going to change automotive technology if we don't already start teleporting everywhere. It's going to be revolutionary."

The men got inside the car, with Swift taking the driver seat, while Cromwell took the front passenger seat.

Swift could see the colonel scanning everything within the car, paying attention to all the newness that were never present in the car.

"Where the gearstick?"

Swift realized suddenly that there was none in this car.
