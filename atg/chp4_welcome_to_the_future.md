# Chapter Four: Welcome to the Future

As John Swift stood in front of the stargate, Swift was still searching in his mind for answers to the reality he was currently facing. He talked to psychologists to test his sanity, and he even tried to find the man who sold him the gate. His search for answers had only beget more questions.

Either he was hallucinating vividly or that he was really witnessing reality. For now he decided that it was the later rather than the former.

Swift made a commitment some time ago to help the formerly fictional SGC with meeting with his government. To be able to do that, he announced that he was taking a sudden and long vacation. Helping out the SGC wasn't something to be taken lightly at all, but it wasn't hard either. It was more like a childhood dream come true, a fulfillment of a fantasy, even if it became more like a responsibility.

So when the SGC requested for a place to stay and set up operation, Swift quickly obliged.

Swift took a look at his phone. It was eight AM sharp. Then the gate's inner ring started moving. There's going to be a gate connection.

Colonel Frank Cromwell emerged from the pool-like portal, the energy field collapsing right behind him. He was dressed in his Battle Dress Uniform(BDU), pulling a wheeled luggage.

"Good to have you back, Colonel," Swift greeted.

"Good to see you as well, Mr. Swift," Cromwell replied back. "Where Sinclair?"

"Probably working at a cafe writing his novel. I already have a place for you to stay at. I'll be driving you there." It was Swift's house. Given the lack of identity and history, there's not a whole of places where they could stay at.

"No butler?"

"Sorry, I am not that kind of person."

When they were were finally at the parking lot, Swift's car's frunk opened up.

"Is this some alternate universe where people put the car engine in the back?" Cromwell asked.

Swift laughed in bemusement. "No, it's nothing like that. With an electric car, our 'engines' are the motors that sat next to each wheel. So there's no need for big engine blocks. That opened up both the back and front for space."

"Oh."

"And the vast majority of cars today on the road are still the cars that you are used. They each have an internal combustion engine inside and use gasoline, but I don't believe that will be the future."

"Because of cars like this?"

"No. It's due to the stargate program. Room temperature superconductors? Antigravity? FTL travel? That's going to change automotive technology if we don't already start teleporting everywhere. It's going to be revolutionary."

The men got inside the car, with Swift taking the driver seat, while Cromwell took the front passenger seat.

Swift could see the colonel scanning everything within the car, paying attention to all the newness that were never present in the car.

"Where the gearstick?"

Swift realized suddenly that his car didn't have a gearstick.

So this was where he will be staying for the foreseeable future. For Swift's wealth, the house was rather modest. It was a standard fare typical three bedroom suburban home.

As he walked toward a guestroom he will be staying in, he realized how the future didn't really change much. There were new and different cars, of course, but they still pollute and consume fossil fuel all the same. Even Swift's car, which ran on electricity wasn't all that different.

Technology had clearly advanced, but it hasn't morphed into unrecognizable form.

For Cromwell, it was also clear that the bedroom still looked and functioned the same as it did in nineteen ninety-eight. There were the closet, dresser, drawers and the mattress, pillows, and so on. If there were any technological changes for the past seventeen years, it was unnoticeable.

When he arrived in the living room, there was a pizzabox on the coffee table, a sign that he was still in America, if in a different dimension altogether.

There were also cardboards and packages strewn around, and new laptops.

"I know you guys asked for the ability to purchase stuff through me," Swift said. "For now, you'll have fifty-thousand dollars limit on what you can purchase, but no rifles or weapons or anything like that. I will be invoicing the expense incurred by ordering using my account to your government. Mainly, it won't be dollars per dollars exchange, but access to your world and the ability to spend some money there."

"I already understood that you negotiated with my government like a good capitalist for consulting fee," Cromwell said. "Thankfully, it was not exorbitant compared to defense contractors. You're downright cheap."

"Naturally, I expect some compensation," Swift said. "My time is expensive, but, I am not going to sucker every dimes and pennies to make a quick buck. I have enough of bullshit. I don't think I need to skewer the SGC for more of their precious resources. Now, let me get this show on the road and show you how to purchase things on the internet."

**General George Hammond**
**SGC, SG-Earth**
**September 24, 1998**

If anything that made Stargate Command unique, it was the fact that the organization was responsible for everything from basic science research, archaeological digs, cultural outreach, espionage and stabotage, direct strike missions, and diplomatic mission.

There was no way that General George Hammond could manage this alone. He didn't have the skillset nor wanted to handle such a dizzingly array of concerns. That meant delegation. Carter and Jackson both respectively head their own scientific department, while O'Neill handles military training and oversee special operation teams assigned here.

Some delegation were ordered from the higher ups. One of them, CIA Station Chief Andrew Brewster was meeting with him today in his office. Hammond didn't so much give orders, but cooperate with the chief on intelligence matters, but mostly left him to his own device to manage SGC's growing spy network.

"I trust that you have no problem with the deal I made with the billionaire John Swift?" Hammond questioned.

"No, general," Brewster said. "As you rightfully pointed out, we have no choice but to trust him to keep the stargate a secret from the public. If he can keep his end of the bargain, we'll create a false identity for him. Of course we'll have the full weight of the law on him once he's on this side."

"If he's not playing a long-con with us and that any punishment we may exact him doesn't scare him."

"There's a risk that he will reveal the secrets if we don't keep our end of the bargain."

"Then as far as we're concerned, we're done with him."

"We'll still need to monitor this man's disposition to see how they change, but that's it."

"Let's move on to the next topic. I asked you to provide a plan on how to contact his government."

The greying man cleared out his throat, before handling him the folder. "I believe this will be mostly a diplomatic operation, rather than an intelligence one, but it still require our expertise in planning covert operation. The overall plan is as followed, our diplomatic envoy will deliver himself to a military base, which will get him arrested. In a briefcase are all select classified materials that will prove our story. The envoy himself with a double of the one that existed on their Earth."

"By classified materials? If they don't believe it, then something might happen that the materials will be released to the public."

"It's a calculated risk. My analysts will select materials that will be of interest to that government yet not pose a dangerous threat to national security if exposed. The president will be giving his own take. If it's a GO, then we'll execute the plan."

"I understand. When will I expect this to be done?"

"Three weeks is the deadline. "

**Colonel Frank Cromwell**
**Hawthrone, Infopunk-Earth**
**September 25, 2015**

There was no cable nor a landline in the house. According to his host, it was outdated. Even in a timeline seventeen years in advanced, Swift reveled on living in the future, just one that was unevenly distributed.

Cromwell eventually turned to the the glowing screen of a newly purchased laptop. That connected to the internet, a network more powerful and captivating than it was in nineteen ninety-eight. In his downtime, he browsed the web like a zombie, subsisting on various media such as books and videos, though he didn't care much for some aspects of the internet. "What do people use?" he would say. The billionaire would reply a number of things that young people use that Swift himself cared not to use.

Of course, there were also work to be done for SGC. It was never in Cromwell's nature to be completely useless or lazy, even if he has to fly a desk. Luckily, homework were provided. Doctor Jackson saw fit to provide a daily questionnaire from his department. O'Neill wanted him to buy all the books on the war on terror, as well as the war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. Carter did tried to give him homework, but it became quickly clear that Cromwell wasn't well versed in that field, so it was dropped.

A light flickered on, lighting the workspace that was the dinning room. Cromwell knew who was in the house from the moment that the garage door opened. An home automation app notified him of that.

"Colonel? You're still sitting there the last time I left," Swift said.

"Yes?"

"Never mind."
