# Chapter Four: Welcome to the Future

**John Swift**

As John Swift stood in front of the stargate, Swift was still searching in his mind for answers to the reality he was currently facing. He talked to psychologists to test his sanity, and he even tried to find the man who sold him the gate. There were only more questions.

He was hallucinating vividly, out of his complete mind, or he was really witnessing all but the impossibility. Even the delusion was agreeing with him.

Colonel Frank Cromwell emerged from the pool-like portal, the energy field collapsing right behind him. He was dressed in his Battle Dress Uniform(BDU), pulling a wheeled luggage.

"Good to have you back, Colonel," Swift greeted.

"Good to see you as well, Mr. Swift," Cromwell replied back. "Where Sinclair?"

"Probably working at a cafe writing his novel. I already have a place for you to stay at. I'll be driving you there."

"No butler?"

"Sorry, I am not that kind of person."

When they were at the finally at the parking lot, Swift's car's frunk opened up.

"Is this some alternate universe where people put the car engine in the back?" Cromwell asked.

Swift laughed. "No, it's nothing like that. It's an electric car. The engines, or rather, the electric motors are by the wheels. The trunk's still available in the back."

"Oh."

"And the vast majority of cars today on the road are still the cars that you are used. They have an internal combustion engine and uses gasoline, but I don't believe that will be the future."

"Because cars like this."

"No. It's due to the stargate program. Room temperature superconductors? Antigravity? FTL travel? That's going to change automotive technology if we don't start teleporting everywhere."
