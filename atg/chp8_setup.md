# Chapter Eight: Setup

**Senator Elizabeth Baldwin**
**October 14, 2015**
**Whitehouse, Infopunk-Earth**

It was not often that the president asked a group of senators to be summoned to the Whitehouse, to the president's office. Senator Elizabeth Baldwin of Michigan, head of the Appropriation Subcommittee on Defense Spending, wondered what was this all about.

The president walked in. He looked tired and beat as any other president would be near the end of their second end year term.

"Welcome," he said in a tired voice, before sitting down. "There's a reason why I wanted you on short notice."

He handed each senators a folder. "I need you to be one hundred percent with me. That's why I need you to fly down to the state of Nevada and see for yourself."

"What is this?" Baldwin said as she flipped through the project description. "Device for interstellar exploration? Faster than light? That sounds like science fiction."

"Can you see why?"

Unfortunately, Baldwin found herself agreeing with a democrat. He's also the President of the United States. There's no room for him to feed the senators absolute garbage on such an important matter.

There's only one answer. "We'll go."

"Thank you."

**Area Fifty-one**

It wasn't easy for her group to believe what the military was telling them, with dozen of individuals from the commander-in-chief to the lowest grunts testifying to the senators that they were in fact not lying at all.

"Come this way," Colonel Mark Whitman said as he lead the senators into a massive hangar. The senators immediately noticed the centerpiece of the entire program, a ring-like object that had light focused on it, clearing a space in the back of the hangar in the sea of people and equipment. Manned machine gun posts were mounted against the ring.

"So this is the stargate," Baldwin said. "So, I am supposed to believe that this device can open up to alien worlds?" The congresswoman couldn't believe what she was saying or taking seriously.

"Yes, it is the Stargate."

"That somehow can connect to an alternate reality where Stargate SG-1 takes place?"

"Yes, senator. It is all true."

"Then I believe you understand the importance of us being able to meet SG-1 in the flesh."

"We already arranged for that."

**Colonel Jack O'Neill**

The Groom Lake facility posed no obstacles to hosting a formal dinner with people in power, specifically the senators who will be funding the black budget Project Blue Sky program.

Of course, with his team's fame already known on the other side of the gate, the senators in charge of a very important subcommittee wanted SG-1 for dinner.

Well, they got it.

"I hope it wasn't a bother for you and your team to come here on a moment's notice," senator Baldwin said.

"No problem, senator. SG-1 sometime doubled as a diplomatic team," O'Neill smiled. "Meeting over a dozen of people across two years made me very good at shutting my mouth. I let Daniel Jackson handle the contact."

"I am very well aware of the roles in the team, but it seemed that SG-1 is larger than what I knew."

"Ah, it's artistic license by those Canadians. I am guessing adding four other actors just make the show more expensive. You shouldn't take television seriously. The writers played very loose with reality."

O'Neill puts a bite of steak in his mouth as casually as he could.
