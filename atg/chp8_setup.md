# Chapter Eight: Setup

**Senator Elizabeth Baldwin**
**October 14, 2015**
**Whitehouse, Infopunk-Earth**

It was not often that the president asked a group of senators to be summoned to the Whitehouse, to the president's office. Senator Elizabeth Baldwin of Michigan, head of the Appropriation Subcommittee on Defense Spending, wondered what was this all about.

The president walked in. He looked tired and beat as any other president would be near the end of their second end year term.

"Welcome," he said in a tired voice, before sitting down. "There's a reason why I wanted you on short notice."

He handed each senators a folder. "I need you to be one hundred percent with me. That's why I need you to fly down to the state of Nevada and see for yourself."

"What is this?" Baldwin said as she flipped through the project description. "Device for interstellar exploration? Faster than light? That sounded like science fiction."

"Can you see why?"

Unfortunately, Baldwin found herself agreeing with a democrat. He's also the President of the United States. There's no room for him to feed the senators absolute garbage on such an important matter.

There's only one answer. "We'll go."

"Thank you."

**Area Fifty-one**

"Come this way," Colonel Mark Whitman said as he lead the senator into a massive hangar. The senators immediately noticed the centerpiece of the entire program, a ring-like object that had light focused on it, clearing a space in the back of the hangar in the sea of people and equipment. Manned machine gun posts were mounted against the ring.

"So this is the stargate," Baldwin said. "So, I am supposed to believe that this device can open up to alien worlds?" The congresswoman couldn't believe what she was saying or taking seriously.

"Yes, it is the Stargate."

"That somehow can connect to an alternate reality where Stargate SG-1 takes place?"
