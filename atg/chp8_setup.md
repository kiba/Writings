# Chapter Eight: Setup

**Senator Elizabeth Baldwin**
**October 14, 2015**
**Whitehouse, Infopunk-Earth**

It was not often that the president asked a group of senators to be summoned to the Whitehouse, to the president's office. Senator Elizabeth Baldwin of Michigan, head of the Appropriation Subcommittee on Defense Spending, wondered what was this all about.

The president walked in. He looked tired and beat as any other president would be near the end of their second end year term.

"Welcome," he said in a tired voice, before sitting down. "There's a reason why I wanted you on short notice."

He handed each senators a folder. "I need you to be one hundred percent with me. That's why I need you to fly down to the state of Nevada and see for yourself."

"What is this?" Baldwin said as she flipped through the project description. "Device for interstellar exploration? Faster than light? That sounded like science fiction."

"Can you see why?"

Unfortunately, Baldwin found herself agreeing with a democrat. He's also the President of the United States. There's no room for him to feed the senators absolute garbage on such an important matter.

There's only one answer. "We'll go."

"Thank you."

**Area Fifty-One**

"Come this way," Colonel Mark Whitman said as he lead the senator into a massive hangar. The senators immediately noticed the centerpiece of the entire program, a ring-like object that had light focused on it, clearing a space in the back of the hangar in the sea of people and equipment. Manned machine gun posts were mounted against the ring.

"What the hell is that?" Senator Jack Markaby of Mississpi echoed her thought.

"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the ring that the president wanted you to fund," Whitman noted.

"Scheduled activation starting in five minutes," the PA speaker said.

"This is the device that can send men to another world? It looked like a stargate," Baldwin said, almost believing.

"That's what we decided that this is."

"Who built it? Where did you discover this? Why now?"

"I would like to demonstrate to you that this is a real device first, before we talk details. Ma'am."

The gate activated, its whirlpool splashing out. Then a robot ascended the ramp and into the wormhole and disappeared.

"We got telemetry." The senators were then shown to a video that showed the surface of an airless planet.

"Is this safe?"

"Of course, ma'am. It's already scouted beforehand."

"What if aliens discover us? What if they are hostile?" There were so many questions coming from her brain that she wanted the military to answer and reassure her on. There was also no doubt in her mind about if she want to fund the study. Of course, she would.

"Scouted by who?" one of her collegue raised the question.

The colonel was silent for a moment before answering, "friendly aliens."

"Great, so we already have first contact," her collegue continued.

"Senator Davidson, you wouldn't believe who the aliens were. So don't shout at me since I am going to sincerely give an answer to you."

"Try me," Davidson said.

"The aliens are not really aliens," he said. "They are from an alternate reality." Davidson was about to reply before the Colonel signaled the senator to stop. "Hear me out. It got crazier than that, even. Have you ever heard of Stargate SG-1."

"I do. My grandson was an avid fan of that show."
