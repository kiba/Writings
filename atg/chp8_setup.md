# Chapter Eight: Setup

***
**Senator Elizabeth Baldwin**
**October 14, 2015**
**Whitehouse, Infopunk-Earth**

It was not often that the president asked a group of senators to be summoned to the Whitehouse, to the president's office. Senator Elizabeth Baldwin of Michigan, head of the Appropriation Subcommittee on Defense Spending, wondered what was this all about.

The president walked in. He looked tired and beat as any other president would be near the end of their second end year term.

"Welcome," he said in a tired voice, before sitting down. "There's a reason why I wanted you on short notice."

He handed each senators a folder. "I need you to be one hundred percent with me. That's why I need you to fly down to the state of Nevada and see for yourself."

"What is this?" Baldwin said as she flipped through the project description. "Device for interstellar exploration? Faster than light? That sounds like science fiction."

"Can you see why?"

Unfortunately, Baldwin found herself agreeing with a democrat. He's also the President of the United States. There's no room for him to feed the senators absolute garbage on such an important matter.

There's only one answer. "We'll go."

"Thank you."

**Area Fifty-one**

It wasn't easy for her group to believe what the military was telling them, with dozen of individuals from the commander-in-chief to the lowest grunts testifying to the senators that they were in fact not lying at all.

"Come this way," Colonel Mark Whitman said as he lead the senators into a massive hangar. The senators immediately noticed the centerpiece of the entire program, a ring-like object that had light focused on it, clearing a space in the back of the hangar in the sea of people and equipment. Manned machine gun posts were mounted against the ring.

"So this is the stargate," Baldwin said. "So, I am supposed to believe that this device can open up to alien worlds?" The congresswoman couldn't believe what she was saying or taking seriously.

"Yes, it is the Stargate."

"That somehow can connect to an alternate reality where Stargate SG-1 takes place?"

"Yes, senator. It is all true."

"Then I believe you understand the importance of us being able to meet SG-1 in the flesh."

"We already arranged for that."

**Colonel Jack O'Neill**
**SGC, SG-Earth**

Every members of the team were all in their mess dress uniform instead of their usual BDU and tactical vests. Teal'c and Jackson were the exception, and both of them opted for the tie and suits.

O'Neill saw it coming, especially when the fictional version of your team is widely celebrated as the lead hero of a television series.

"Although, you all know this. I am going to tell you anyway. This is important," Hammond said solemnly. "Our ally are a quite a fan of SG-1 team, even if that is missing..." The general looked around. "Half of the team."

The team chuckled at that.

"There are lawmakers that want to meet the team that they watched on their television set, while their military is gauging our professionalism, honor, and dedication to excellence. I expect you all to be on your best behaviors. That go double for you, Colonel O'Neill, even though they know your reputation."

"The insubordination is from a character," O'Neill quipped.

"Regardless, it is what they know of you, and it is true."

"Yes sir, I'll do my best to not piss them off."

"I am glad you understand."

The eight member of the team crossed over to an alternate reality as easily they crossed over to any other gate. All of this was possible because Carter was able to understand the principles behind dimensional travel, and assure everyone else that they won't get accidentally stranded. All of this was buried in the DHD codebase.

Immediately when the team arrived, O'Neill already sighted the senators that are deciding the budget for Earth's most important ally's stargate program.

From the start, this was also a political mission in addition to a party. O'Neill detested those kind of missions almost as the missions where everything went FUBAR, but alas, it was important.

"That's the senators," Carter whispered. "Be ready."

"I know who they are and what they are looking for," O'Neill replied. "Teal'c, you know what to do. Be quiet and look impressive. Jackson, you're going to do most of the talking."

"Who? Me?" Jackson protested. "I don't do politics!"

"You're the all-round diplomacy guy. You're the closest stand-in to politics."

"So you are the SG-1 that I keep hearing about," senator Baldwin said. "I represent Michigan. My grandson is a huge fan of the show that tells your live."

"Mrs. Senator, it's all fictional," O'Neill said with a smile. "But I am authorized by my superior to tell you stories of my team's exploits. It's the real thing."

"Oh. I am looking forward to that."

O'Neill sure hoped that he didn't get baited into a trap.

SG-1 and the senators were eventually airlifted to a secret location for a dinner with some of the notables that will be involved in his ally's secret stargate program. The facility at area fifty-one was all business, not equip to host formal occasions like this.

There, scientists, politicians, soldiers, mix together, talking about the future and the first contact incident. Even the diplomat Parkinson was there.

It was a fairly relaxing time, none of that 'politics' as O'Neill feared. Still, he took an opportunity for respite by hanging at the edge of a balcony and staring at the stars in the night sky. There wasn't much to see. The stars were drowned out by light pollution.

"How's your evening, Colonel?" Baldwin interrupted with a cup of wine in her hand.

"I am fine. I thought I was going to be bored to tear, but I am enjoying myself so far. My team normally has a more active role."

"I know. You told me those wonderful stories. Stories that I couldn't yet divulge to my grandchildren."

"May I ask what is your position on the stargate program?"

"There is no doubt that I will fund the study of the stargate and the expense needed to connect to your world. I see values in that."

"But..."

"But, I am unconvinced on the value of exploration."

"Why?"

"I recalled that you set off a galactic civil war by killing Ra. Should did anything go wrong, he could have come to your Earth and crush your home under his foot."

"I didn't know that there was going to be a Ra, and we took a risk in opening gate, but in doing so,  learn who our enemies are. What does that have to do with exploration anyway?"

"That gate is a pandora's box," Baldwin said with complete seriousness. "Your world opened up your gate, and now you are forced to a play a galactic game for survival. What if it happens to this Earth as well? What if we explore our reality and found enemies to contend with?"

"You are already playing with us," O'Neill said. "Your gate, just like any other gate can be dialed. If you want to prevent anyone coming in, the president should order the stargate to be buried."

Baldwin was jolted, her eyes completely focused on O'Neill's face. "I never thought about cutting off connection just before this moment. I am considering it right now at this very moment."

"You are going to walk away just like that?"

The senator pulled a picture out of her purse before showing it to the Colonel. "This is my family, and this is my grandson. I know he would love to meet with you, but I don't know if he's going to like living in a world where we could be blown away by an alien threat."

O'Neill took a deep breath, pausing to think about the answer to the senator's worry.

"Exploration is risky," O'Neill said. "I know what it's like since I am on the front line. But staying home and twiddling with your thumb is also a risk. They say that ignorance is bliss, but I also say that ignorance is a weakness. If you don't know what is going on in your own stellar neighborhood, how will you even know that something is coming for you? It's cliched, but knowledge is power. If you shut off the gate, senator, you will also shut off the flow of knowledge and resources needed to defend your world should a hostile alien power makes their presence known in your solar system."

"I don't want a Ra situation."

"I don't think your world can afford to not explore, but Stargate Command has a lot of experience on how to explore safely. Our standard operating procedures are paved in blood. We can help you with that."

"I'll think on it. Thank you for your ernest argument, but I know you are also angling for an alliance with us to protect your world."

"An alliance? With my very own people? We may live in dimension, but we are the United States of America. We are the people of Earth."

O'Neill could see the guilt on the senator's body language. She was looking down, her eyes averted from the Colonel.

The airman knew that he done a good job on emotional manipulation.

But he also knew that it was also the truth.
