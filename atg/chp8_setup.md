# Chapter Eight: Setup

**Senator Elizabeth Baldwin**
**October 24, 2015**
**Whitehouse, Infopunk-Earth**

Republican Senator Elizabeth Baldwin, head of the Appropriation Subcommittee on Defense Spending, did not like the president one bit.

Yet, she was summoned by the president for a secret meeting. He said that it was important. Whatever importance that was, she could hardly told him to get lost. That wouldn't be good for the country.

The president walked in. From the door, she could see that a general was involved. "Sorry senator Baldwin, I was held up by urgent manners."

"Well, what do you need to see me for?" Baldwin asked.

"It's very important," the president said as he handed her a folder. "You need to fly to the state of Nevada, and head there, because I need you to be one hundred percent with me?"
