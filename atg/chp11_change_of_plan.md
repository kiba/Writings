**John Swift**

**November 3, 1998**

The billionaire was forbidden to drive his electric vehicle to the other side. Nor did they let him take his smartphone and other gadgets. Not even his usual clothes was permitted.

Swift thought that the organization was paranoid to a fault, but he couldn't blame them. There are snake bastards swimming around on this world after all. According to the news, Seth was killed in a raid a little while ago.

It wasn't worth the hassle, so he brought clothes and accessories from shops Colorado Spring blind, with the help of an airman. He tried whatever fit.

Swift learned a long time ago that there was no Eli Berkovitz or any of his relatives in this reality. Instead he found an equvalient, two South African entrepreneurs running this company.

The billionaire walked confidently into the business place.

"How may I help you?" the receptionist asked.

"I would like to invest in this company," Swift said.

Weeks had passed as he vacationed in the middle of the dot-com boom. Eventually, he returned to Colorado Spring and to the company he started up there.

It was unusual, catering to the Department of Defense, but Swift reminded himself that he was really on the cutting edge. He wasn't dealing with an old ossified bureaucracy here, but an agile and well run organization, emblem of the United States military at its best.

The SGC's software quality wasn't the greatest. Their engineers and scientists were not by any great programmers. The software code does what it do, and no more.
