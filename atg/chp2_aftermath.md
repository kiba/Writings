# **Chapter 2: Aftermath**

After a well deserved slept-in and a few days off, Colonel Johnathan 'Jack' O'Neill found himself back in familiar routine, standing outside one of his teammate's office.

He knocked on the door.

"Who is it?" the voice on the side of door asked.

"I am back," O'Neill said simply.

"Oh, hey Jack," the civilian greeted the Air Force special operator.

"Homework, then lunch."

"Right errr...let me find my Goa'uld worksheet."

It would be very convenient if the galaxy at large spoke English for his team's benefit. Alas, his team has yet to come across a universal language translator to reverse engineer it from. At least the galaxy at large do speak a lingua franca, which is Goa'uld. Which means that Teal'c and Jackson can interact with the locals. The only problem with that language is that you can be sure that some kooky Goa'uld overlord had influenced that particular gate address in some way or fashion, frequently in a traumatizing sort of way. Unless they're tok'ra. Tok'ra are the good guys. That's more of an exception.

To increase operational efficiency of stargate exploration teams, it became a staple of the local learning curriculum to learn Goa'uld, not that it was any particularly new to O'Neill Throughout his military career, more specifically, special operation, he was always learning the languages of allies, like German, and sometime the enemies as well, such as Russian. His time at this command was no exception.

But god damn it! This man needed to be better organized. The good doctor was still ruffling through the mess to find homework.

After waiting several minutes or so, the archaeologist found the team's homework. He handed O'Neill a copy.

"We need a better way than this mess. Like using the computer to send our homework through email," O'Neill thought out loud.

"I am not just that good at computers. When I was a professor, this is what I always do. Excuse me, I was simply a lecturer."

"Daniel, I don't care about the excuses you make in the past. This is not good enough."

The doctor shrugged.

At least the worksheet weren't the feel good bullshit mandated by bureaucrats, or god forbidden, [i]congress[/i]. There was a reason all these years that he tried to stay retired until some evil snakehead invaded Cheyenne mountain.

"Doctor, just print the god damn worksheet the next time," O'Neill said.

"I have a system," the doctor said defensively. "And it's a waste of money and paper to just print like that."

"In case you didn't notice, you are no longer a poorly paid humanity professor. You provide actionable intelligence day in day out on a daily basis which not only helped this team survive the many incidents, but also saved Stargate Command several times. A nickel or whatever it is, isn't going to hurt your six figures income plus tax-free hazard pay and medical benefits."

"OK. Fine. Whatever, I'll print the damn thing next time."

"Good..let's get the rest of the team."

As a precaution, General Hammond shut down gate explorations until further notice after the near disastrous black hole incident. An incident review procedure was initialized. Everyone involved in the incident were interviewed by an independent team, who also exhaustively examined everything. Then there were the debriefing with the higher-ups. Finally, changes was made to SGC's standard operating procedures to never let this happen again.

The black hole, however rare and improbable, almost engulfed Stargate Command, and perhaps Earth as well. Surviving by the skin of the teeth and keep going as if it never happened? Unacceptable.

Captain Carter's own improvised solution became a ready-made solution and a new set of exercise. A shaped charge bomb became reserved for this type of incident as well as several components required for a successful denotation.

Pretty soon, Stargate Command personnel will be drilled regularly so that the response can be delivered in the right time. The only problem was that the bomb would refuse to stay parallel to the ground with no practical way to simulate the powerful force of gravity emanating from the stargate.

Still, that wasn't enough for Hammond. He authorized a new project out of SGC's emergency fund to explore preventative measures proposed by the physics department.

As a result of all of this, Carter found herself with boxes of electronics and equipment stacked in her office and a clipboard in her hands. She flew a fighter jet during Desert Shield and Desert Storm some seven years ago, so the treasure trove of really expensive electronics made her only mildly nervous.

Still, it would be on her head if anything were to be missing. So Carter was inventorying every box personally.

These are the latest cesium atomic clock. She came up with a proposal to tie the atomic clock to the SGC sensor grid and to the DHD to act as an early warning system for faster than normal time dilation. Time dilation was a fact of physics in this universe, even on Earth, though it depend on where you are at any given moment.

Physics wise, it shouldn't be anything out of her depth. Einstein's theory of relativity came into play, but not hyperspace, faster than light, or subspace. Any of those concepts would give her a  hugeheadache any time of the day, and she was one of the best of her generation.

There was a knock on the door.

"Who is it?" she said.

"Carter, it's lunchtime," her commanding officer said.

"I'll be there in a minute. Just need to check one last box off."

When she was done, she joined the Jackson and O'Neill to the local cafe.

It was a Friday, and Teal'c found himself in the company of Tau'ri warriors at a local gym, facing a total of five sparring partners in the ring.

This was routine, absolutely normal, part of an ongoing exchange of knowledge. While the Jaffa are vastly inferior soldiers to the Tau'ri in general ground combat, it did not mean that the Jaffa knew nothing about fighting.

On the contrary, they can be excellent warriors and soldiers, as good as any Tau'ri soldiers, if they were allowed to use their mind, discipline, and skills.

"3...2...1....begin."

His opponents rushed the Jaffa as soon as they began. The First Prime grabbed the nearest Tau'ri, allowing to be punched by another airman. He dropped the opponent on the ground, and grabbed another man before dropping him to the ground.

He soon made quick work of the rest of his sparring partners, almost as if Teal'c was in a martial art movie. Finally, with all five airmen scrawling on the ground, Teal'c bowed.

Polite applause came. By then, the Tau'ri were used to this display of skills from a century old warrior.

"Anyone would like to try?" he asked the audience.

Several hands rose. Teal'c picked at individuals he hadn't seen recently. Several more bouts to go before he would proceed to showing a new kata.

An hour passed by. Already, most of SG-1 were standing outside when Teal'c walked out the door.

"How's class?" O'Neill asked.

"Most excellent. Normal and routine," Teal'c appraised. "A Jaffa warrior is very difficult take on in melee combat, but I believed some of my students now have a fighting chance to stay alive."

O'Neill smiled. "I am glad we aren't totally outmuscled in that department. We're going to go to a diner nearby for lunch. Want to come with us?"

"I gladly accept your offer."

**Jack O'Neill**

What kind of a restaurant named itself O'Malley? He shrugged at that. Regardless, they have good beer and really good steak.

The entire SG-1 team was present, all eight of them.
