# **Chapter Two: Aftermath**

**Colonel Jack O'Neill**
**Stargate Command, SG-Earth**

After a well deserved slept-in and a few days off, Colonel Johnathan 'Jack' O'Neill found himself back in familiar routine, standing outside one of his teammate's office.

He knocked on the door.

"Who is it?" the voice on the side of door asked.

"I am back," O'Neill said simply.

"Oh, hey Jack," the civilian greeted the Air Force special operator.

"Homework, then lunch."

"Right errr...let me find my Goa'uld worksheet."

It would be very convenient if the galaxy at large spoke English for his team's benefit. Alas, his team has yet to come across a universal language translator to reverse engineer it from. At least the galaxy at large do speak a lingua franca, which is Goa'uld. Which means that Teal'c and Jackson can interact with the locals. The only problem with that language is that you can be sure that some kooky Goa'uld overlord had influenced that particular gate address in some way or fashion, frequently in a traumatizing sort of way. Unless they're tok'ra. Tok'ra are the good guys. That's more of an exception.

To increase the field efficacy and efficiency of stargate exploration teams, it became a staple of the local learning curriculum to learn Goa'uld, not that it was any particularly new to O'Neill. Throughout his military career, more specifically, special operation, he was always learning the languages of allies, like German, and sometime the enemies as well, such as Russian. His time at this command was no exception.

But god damn it! This man needed to be better organized. The good doctor was still ruffling through the mess to find homework.

After waiting several minutes or so, the archaeologist found the team's homework. He handed O'Neill a copy.

"We need a better way than this mess. Like using the computer to send our homework through email," O'Neill thought out loud.

"I am not just that good at computers. When I was a professor, this is what I always do. Excuse me, I was simply a lecturer."

"Daniel, I don't care about the excuses you make in the past. This is not good enough."

The doctor shrugged.

At least the worksheet weren't the feel good bullshit mandated by bureaucrats, or god forbidden, [i]congress[/i]. There was a reason all these years that he tried to stay retired until some evil snakehead invaded Cheyenne mountain.

"Doctor, just print the god damn worksheet the next time," O'Neill said.

"I have a system," the doctor said defensively. "And it's a waste of money and paper to just print like that."

"In case you didn't notice, you are no longer a poorly paid humanity professor. You provide actionable intelligence day in day out on a daily basis which not only helped this team survive the many incidents, but also saved Stargate Command several times. A nickel or whatever it is, isn't going to hurt your six figures income plus tax-free hazard pay and medical benefits."

"OK. Fine. Whatever, I'll print the damn thing next time."

"Good..let's get the rest of the team."

**Captain Samantha Carter**

As a precaution, General Hammond shut down gate explorations until further notice after the near disastrous black hole incident. An incident review procedure was initialized, and an independent team took charge of the investigation. They interviewed everyone and everything, performed root cause analysis, and made a number of recommendations for SGC to implement. Then there were the debriefing with the higher-ups. Finally, changes was made to SGC's standard operating procedures to never let this happen again.

The black hole may be extremely rare, but it almost engulfed Stargate Command and maybe Earth as well. To march on forward pretending that it never happened. That was unacceptable. Public opinion would torn Stargate Command and its personnel apart.

Captain Carter's own improvised solution became a ready-made solution and a new set of exercise. A shaped charge bomb became reserved for this type of incident as well as several components required for a successful denotation.

Pretty soon, Stargate Command personnels will be drilled so regularly so that the response will be delivered at the right time.

Still, that wasn't enough for Hammond. He authorized a new project out of SGC's emergency fund to explore preventative measures proposed by the physics department.

As a result of all of this, Carter found herself with boxes of electronics and equipment stacked in her office and a clipboard in her hands. She flew a fighter jet during Desert Shield and Desert Storm years ago, so the treasure trove of really expensive electronics made her only mildly nervous.

There was no doubt in her mind that nobody would dare try to steal anything from her. Still, through a force of habit, Carter personally inventoried every single box herself.

These are the latest cesium atomic clock. She came up with a proposal to tie the atomic clock to the SGC sensor grid and to the DHD supercomputer to act as an early warning system for faster than normal time dilation, the kind that would portent a black hole that's too near.

Physics wise, it shouldn't be anything out of her depth. Einstein's theory of relativity came into play, but not hyperspace, faster than light, or subspace. Any of those concepts would give her a  huge headache any time of the day, and she was one of the best of her generation.

There was a knock on the door.

"Who is it?" she said.

"Carter, it's lunchtime," her commanding officer said.

"I'll be there in a minute. Just need to check one last box off."

When she was done, she joined the rest of SG-1 at a local resturant.

***

It was a Friday, and Teal'c was instructing Tau'ri warriors at the gym, facing five sparring opponents.

This was routine, absolutely normal, part of an ongoing exchange of knowledge. While the Jaffa are vastly inferior soldiers to the Tau'ri in general ground combat, it did not mean that the Jaffa knew nothing about fighting.

On the contrary, they can be excellent warriors and soldiers, as good as any Tau'ri soldiers, if they were allowed to use their mind, discipline, and skills.

"Three, two, one....begin."

His opponents rushed the Jaffa as soon as they began. The First Prime grabbed the nearest Tau'ri, allowing to be punched by another airman. He dropped the opponent on the ground, and grabbed another man before dropping him to the ground.

He soon made quick work of the rest of his sparring partners, almost as if Teal'c was in a martial art movie. Finally, with all five airmen scrawling on the ground, Teal'c bowed.

Polite applause came. By then, the Tau'ri were used to this display of skills of a nearly century old warrior.

"Anyone would like to try?" he asked the audience.

Several hands rose. Teal'c picked at individuals he hadn't seen recently. Several more bouts to go before he would proceed to showing a new kata.

An hour passed by. Already, most of SG-1 were standing outside when Teal'c walked out the door.

"How's class?" O'Neill asked.

"Excellent as usual. Normal and routine," Teal'c appraised. "A Jaffa warrior is very difficult take on in melee combat, but I believed some of my students now have a fighting chance to stay alive."

O'Neill smiled. "I am glad we aren't totally outmuscled in that department. We're going to go to a diner nearby for lunch. Want to come with us?"

"I gladly accept your offer."

**Major Charles Kawalsky**

It was the lounge, the only room to hang out downstair of NORAD, and it was small too. Still, Major Charles Kawalsky appreciated it all the same for the downtime it represented.

"Remember the time I got infected with one of damn snake?" Kawalsky reminisced. There were sudden sour looks by his teammates.

It wasn't certainly one of his best episode. Only through experimental surgery that Kawalsky made it out alive. Now Doctor Fraiser made sure to check everybody's neck for scars, and of course, there were the usual x-ray scan to double check. Actually, nobody got in or out of SGC without a neck check.

"Do we have to talk about this?" Casey asked.

"Just hear me out, will ya? Right now, we prevent infection by doing neck checks, since that's how they infiltrated our ranks. What if...." He took out a napkin and drew a collar. "We prevent infection by making it impossible for them to bite through?"

"It would work until they figure out that they can't do that anymore. They would switch around to jumping into our mouth, like those Tok'ra agents," Sergeant Warren opined. "Then we'll have no way of distinguishing a good snake from bad. Even if we prevent them from jumping into our mind, how are we going to deal with them jumping into our back?"

"We do wear backpacks and vests that provided some protection," Kawalsky pointed out.

"The only way that we would have complete protection from goa'uld puppetry is if we wear some power armor," Casey said dreamingly. "If the eggheads could figure out how to get those naquadah power cells working..."

"I am told that even with a power cell, it's a long way from building a practical exoskeleton that don't get in the way," Kawalsky said. "At least we got a lot of staff weapons to take cells from. That won't be an issue."

A head popped from the doorway.

"Hey guys," O'Neill said. "Lunchtime."



***
**Jack O'Neill**
**O'Malley Restaurant, Colorado Spring**

What kind of a restaurant named itself O'Malley? He shrugged at that. Regardless, they have good beer and really good steaks. As far as he was concerned, this was another weekly outing for the team.

His entire team was here today, with Kawalsky, Warren, Casey, and Ferreti, who are the squad members protecting the retreat to the gate, and his subject matter experts, Carter, Teal'c, and Jackson.

O'Neill stood up, and the conversation around the dining table stopped. He raised his glass.

"Before we get started on lunch, I would like to toast to my good friend Colonel Frank Cromwell, who passed away after a battle with cancer," he half-lied. The truth was that Cromwell died a hero, protecting Earth from total annihilation.

That was the secret that cannot be told out loud in the public.

"I believe that all of you know Cromwell in one form or another, even if you were just passing him by. Let me say that he's unequivocally a good man, as much as I despise him for what he did or didn't do. It's my regret that I ha-haven't...reconcile on that."

"Amen," a voice said among other utterance of agreement. There was no way that they were going to say that he's a hero out loud in public, but they knew. Everyone knew.

Glasses clinked for Frank Cromwell. It would not be the last time nor the first time that they toasted for someone in the SGC community who died.

Hammond finally lift the order that stopped exploration activities for the past few weeks, the gate only connecting to off-world outposts and for emergency contact with the larger galaxy.

Of course, even under those weeks, SGC never really slept, as there were always something to do. Jackson and Carter were allowed more time to do research, but they report for team training and combat exercises. Then, there were drills, and the constant stream of them.

Now, he was in the operation room, watching Chief Master Sergeant Harriman dialed a completely new address.

If there's a connection, the standard operating procedure would be to send in a rover, check things out. See if it's possible to breathe. Only then would SG-1 embark on a new mission into the unknown.

"And we have a connection!" Harriman said in excitement. "Commencing operation."

Sure enough, the MALP, an ugly piece of machine advance dup the ramp, disappearing into the portal, and emerging on the other side.

Only that O'Neill was looking at a dead man's face, with a pistol aimed at the MALP.
