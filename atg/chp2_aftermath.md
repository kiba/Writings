# **Chapter 2: Aftermath**

After a well deserved slept-in, Colonel Johnathan 'Jack' O'Neill was back up again, standing outside one of his teammate's office.

He knocked on the door, which then opened up to the archaeologist's office.

"Oh, hey Jack," the civilian greeted the Air Force special operator.

"Homework, then lunch."

"Right errr...let me find my Goa'uld worksheet."

Unlike what some science fiction shows would had you believe, nobody in the galaxy conveniently spoke English. This fact was true on Earth, why wouldn't it be true in the galaxy at large? It was only thanks to Jackson and Teal'c that they were able to unravel the Goa'uld language, allowing Stargate Command to interact with Goa'uld influenced civilization.

Since then, it became a staple of the local learning curriculum to learn Goa'uld. Throughout his career, O'Neill had to always learn something new, either as part of 'homework' or actually going to school. Since he was and still is special operation, part of his time was spent on learning the languages of his enemies, or his allies, such as German and Russian. His time at Stargate Command was no exception, except he got his homework directly from the source.

But god damn, this man needed to be better organized. The doctor was still ruffling through his mess to find O'Neill's homework.

"I hope your office didn't eat my homework," the Colonel joked.

"Haha," the archaeologist responded sarcastically.

After a good minute or two, the archaeologist found the team's homework. He handed O'Neill a copy.

"We need a better way than this mess. Like using the computer to send our homework through email," O'Neill thought out loud.

"I am not just that good at computers. When I was a professor, this is what I always do."

"Daniel, it's not good enough."

The doctor shrugged.

At least those homework weren't the bullshit mandated by the bureaucrats, or god forbidden, [I]congress[/I]. O'Neill could take on field operations any day, or any number of language or science homework, so long as the Colonel can recognize the value. Rather, it was the pointless or mind-numbing paperworks that taken his toll on him, which was one reason why he tried to stay retired.

"Well, Doctor, just print the god damn worksheet the next time," O'Neill said. "And while you're at it, maybe it would do to stay organized?"

"I have a system," the doctor said defensively.

"Right....Let get the rest of the team, then."

General Hammond shut down gate explorations until further notice after the black hole incident that nearly engulfed stargate command and perhaps Earth in the process as well. This then triggered an incident review with those involved and the higher ups. After the debriefing, changes was made to SGC's standard operating procedures to never let this happen again.

Captain Carter's own improvised solution became a ready-made solution and a drill. A shaped charge bomb became reserved for this type of incident as well as several components required for a successful denotation.

Pretty soon, Stargate Command personnel will be drilled regularly so that the response can be delivered in the right time. The only problem was that the bomb would refuse to stay parallel to the ground with no practical way to simulate the powerful force of gravity emanating from the stargate.

Still, that wasn't enough for Hammond. He authorized a new project out of SGC's emergency fund to explore preventative measures proposed by the physics department.

As a result of all of this, Carter found herself with boxes of electronics and equipment stacked in her office and a clipboard in her hands. She flew a fighter jet during Desert Shield and Desert Storm some seven years ago, so the treasure trove of really expensive electronics made her only mildly nervous.

Still, it would be on her head if anything were to be missing. So Carter was inventorying every box personally.

These are the latest cesium atomic clock. She came up with a proposal to tie the atomic clock to the SGC sensor grid and to the DHD to act as an early warning system for faster than normal time dilation. Time dilation was a fact of physics in this universe, even on Earth, though it depend on where you are at any given moment.

Physics wise, it shouldn't be anything out of her depth. Einstein's theory of relativity came into play, but not hyperspace, faster than light, or subspace. Any of those concepts would give the best physicists a headache any time of the day, and she was one of the best.

There was a knock on the door.

"Who is it?" she said.

"Carter, it's lunchtime," her commanding officer said.

"I'll be there in a minute. Just need to check one last box off."

When she was done, she joined the Jackson and O'Neill to the local cafe.

It was a Friday, and Teal'c found himself in the company of Tau'ri warriors at a local gym, facing a total of five sparring partners in the ring.

This was routine, absolutely normal, part of an ongoing exchange of knowledge. While the Jaffa are vastly inferior soldiers to the Tau'ri in general ground combat, it did not mean that the Jaffa knew nothing about fighting.

On the contrary, they can be excellent warriors and soldiers, as good as any Tau'ri soldiers, if they were allowed to use their mind, discipline, and skills.

"3...2...1....begin."

His opponents rushed the Jaffa as soon as they began. The First Prime grabbed the nearest Tau'ri and made him the victim of a blue on blue attack.

He soon made quick work of the rest of his sparring partners, almost as if Teal'c was in a martial art movie. Finally, with all five airmen scrawling on the ground, Teal'c bowed to the sounds of applause from the spectators.

By then, the Tau'ri were used to this display of skills from a century old warrior.

"Anyone would like to try?" he asked the audience.

Several hands rose. Teal'c picked at individuals he hadn't seen recently. Several more bouts to go before he would proceed to showing a new kata.
