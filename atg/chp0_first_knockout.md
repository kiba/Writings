John Swift admired the gigantic prop that he had brought off the internet. It looked like the real thing and even weighed the same; 29 metric tons. He had it set up in his garage, where he ran his company from in the early days,. The prop was complete with warning lines for anyone stupid enough to get too close to the gate, especially when it was active, not that the gate will actually harm anyone. He even had an old style casing for a computer set up as a DHD device, complete with animation and sounds.

Of course, it wasn't real. Einstein popped everyone's dream of exploring the galaxy long ago with his pesky theory of relativity, and no amount of wishful thinking will change otherwise. That aside, the prop showcased superb craftmanship, with extreme attention to details. There's even the god damn source code to look at, which was responsible for everything on the DHD computer.

"So, this is what you brought for one million dollars?" a redhead beside him said. He turned his face toward his girlfriend.

Her arms were folded up, and she was practically scowling at him.

"What?"

"What the hell you're going to do with it? Stare at it all day and then forget about it?"

Suddenly, Swift's smile disappeared under her glare and common sense.

"I um-um-um."

"I thought so."

"I am a god damn billionaire! I can spend my money any way I want!" Swift replied indignantly.

"You can spend it on a nice dinner with me. Spend it on saving starving people. Spend it on resurrecting your favorite show. I don't care. BUT YOU DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON MILLION DOLLARS PROPS THAT YOU ONLY STARE FOR 30 MINUTES AND FORGET ABOUT IT!"

Her rant spent, she breathed heavily to catch her breath.

"Are you done?"

"And what will you do with it?"

"I am going to do nothing just to piss you off," he said with a defiant smile.

Her eyes twitched.

"And you don't want to spend million of dollars making productive use of the prop for a new television series?"

God damn. She got a point.

Suddenly, a mechanical sound emanated from his garage.

"What the hell?" he said.

"Congratulation, your prop just got more use-"

The chevron locked and engaged. A blue pool formed after an unstable vortex splashed out. The billionaire couple stared at the prop with mouth agape, before a person was thrown out, flying at them.

"GUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!"

A man flew out and hit the couple, knocking them unconscious.

"O'Neill?" the flying man said as he emerged from his subconciousness. "No. I am in a different place. Should be deep in a mountain, swallowed up by a black hole."

He was wearing a uniform, which looked military, and his BDU would identify him as part of the United States Air Force, in the nineties. His hairs hinted at some white hairs, and the wrinkles on his face obviously identify him as an older man.

However, one glance on his right breast immediately ranked him as a USAF Colonel.

He immediately caught sight of the knocked out pair, but he also took in his surrounding as well.

"This look like the suburb?"
