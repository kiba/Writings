**John Swift**
**September 16, 2015**

He could have lost all his money, most likely either during the financial crisis, or during the dot-com crash. At age thirty five, John Swift became a self-made billionaire.

Swift first made his fortune when Bitpal, an internet payment company, was sold to eBUY, an online auction marketplace. From there, he could have played it safe. But he wasn't satisfied to that end.

Among other things, he decided to invest in Eli Berkovitz's enterprises. He was a billionaire looking to turn his billions into millions by tackling some of the most difficult product categories one could think of: electric cars and rockets. Which was why everybody at the time thought Berkovitz was crazy. By extension, everybody also thought Swift was crazy for going along with the aspiring industrialist.

Far from being overconfident and delusional, Swift knew that he would most likely lose his shirt, and would be forced to start all over again. That was OK with him.

But when the financial crisis struck in the closing years of the last decade, Berkovitz's companies were suddenly in deep trouble, and the duo's dream of routine spaceflight and the colonization of Mars was in jeopardy. At that time, the Israeli-American entrepreneur had yet to successfully launch a rocket into low earth orbit, having failed three times in a row. When Berkovitz came looking for further investment, Swift, a romantic, went all in and saved the companies from bankruptcy. After an almost catastrophic two thousand eight, there was only uncertainty about success.

Since then, Berkovitz delivered on his promises, and coupled with Swift's unicorn investments, Swift had became wealthier than he ever thought possible. He became celebrated in Silicon Valley and in the media at large as the Bitpal mafioso who saved Christmas. His face was splattered all over business magazines all spinning a tale about how shrewd and what a visionary he was.

The truth was the opposite in many ways. Swift, the billionaire, wasn't the super-rational person the media had made him out to be. He was a dreamer and a romantic, and he trusted Berkovitz to make it out alive. In retrospect, any number of things could have derailed his friend's ability to rescue his companies from death. All it took was one more launch failure, or perhaps worsening financial condition, or even a failure to win a contract from NASA.

Today, in two thousand fifteen, that uncertainty had largely given way to a less stressful present and an optimistic and bright future.

He drove a luxury electric sedan, a fruit of his investment, from Berkovitz Electric. He wasn't the only person in the car. Next to him was an up and incoming science fiction novelist, by the name of Vincent Sinclair, whose work he had been reading as of late. The author was busily gawking at the fact that he was sitting beside a visionary billionaire.

The car cruised quietly to a warehouse district in Frost Point, California. It was the quintessential American city. Loads of parking lots, cars, uniform zoning, and very little in the way of public transportation and walkability, and a whole lot of other anti-features that would make a New Urbanist city planner blanch in disgust.

This was not Swift's concern. On his mind, was the production cost of two million dollars per episode for a rebooted science fiction series, based on historical data. A twenty-six episodes season would cost him at least fifty two million dollars, and that's not including license acquisition from the studio that created it, marketing, distribution, and other the costs that he had accounted for.

Overall, he budgeted no greater than ninety million dollars for this project, not even a scant one percent of his overall net worth. Still, it was a quite risky project given that he never produced a television series before. Money was no object, but he cared about putting out a good product.

"Hello? Mr. Swift?" Sinclair asked.

"Ah, sorry, I was thinking, and my driving was on autopilot," Swift answered, having already parked the car absently and without thought.

The author chuckled. "That happened quite frequently to me, given that I was always swallowed up constantly by the novel that I was working on. I would drive home without the slightest idea of the route that I took. Of course, as required of me, I made sure to signal and all that. Then I would worry about the mistakes I made by reviewing the dashcam footage. It usually turned out that I didn't make any mistakes."

"You're a peculiar man, Mr. Sinclair. Scared of police brutality?"

"I heard various cases on the news frequently. It's very unfortunate. But no, I am just a worrywart. I worry about the most inconsequential things sometimes, contrary to my emotional and physical well being. By the way, what are you here to show me?"

The billionaire smiled. "Well, we do not have walk far to find out."

"If you insist..."

The duo got out of the electric sedan, with the author following the billionaire to the entrance. Swift fished the warehouse key from one of his pockets. After inserting his key and turning it to the left, he punched the number pad to unlock the other lock.

Finally, the door opened up to a vast warehouse, that was painted pristine white, in the fashion of Berkovitz's factories. Moreover, in the middle of this warehouse was the set for the franchise that John Swift set out to reboot.

"MY GOD!" the author shouted. Already, the man was feeling goosebumps as the excitement built, "Is this....a..."

"Yes, it's a Stargate set," the billionaire said proudly. "Yes, I absolutely intend to reboot Stargate SG-1. You may not have any time for reading gossip and news, but word's out in Hollywood that I was hiring carpenters and modelmakers. I even got one of the Legendbusters to work on the set for a few weeks or so with a NDA."

"Michael Lacereate and Jade Heineman?"

"You recall that they were special effect experts before they began busting urban legends?"

"I forgot about that."

"Well, I employed them because I am a fan of their show. They're good at special effects and prop-makings, but I could hire anybody like that. A bit more expensive on the budget, but I don't plan on indulging too much. On the other hand..."

The billionaire and amateur TV producer pointed to the stargate prop sitting in the middle of the half-finished set.

"Well-made, like everything else."

"It's a bit special. Not only did I get it for cheap at something like five thousand dollars, but it's also a high quality prop. It even weighs twenty-nine metric tons."

"You're serious?"

"I am absolutely serious. Let's walk there, shall we?"

As the two men closed in on the television set, they noticed the incredible details that went into the set. There were detailed warnings, working lights, security cameras, and pipes that seemed connected to each other.

"Those security cameras, are they operational?" the author asked.

"Yeah. We even got a fully working security room, and we can use those feeds to build additional footage for the show. I even got goPro cameras, in addition to all the standard equipment needed to record a show. But the cameras aren't the only working electronics."

They climbed upstairs to the operation room overlooking the gate below.

"Wow! All those buttons!" Vincent said, already impressed with the tour so far.

"I just told you earlier that I got the gate prop for five thousand dollars. Well, I got the DHD prop too. Those keyboards actually work, in the sense that they are real machines. It can even control the rotation of the stargate, how fast it goes, which symbol it will lock on, and so on. The only real shame is that the gate isn't actually a real stargate."

Now that the author was actually closer to the gate, he noticed that the details were pretty different from the original stargate.

"I see that you made some changes?" Sinclair noted, "All those symbols on the gate...There's more than thirty-nine letters?"

"That's correct. The propmaker went overboard on the gate symbols and letters when he went into making the gate. He also wrote the software that the DHD prop uses. It's an integral part of the prop, and as far as I am concerned, I would be hard pressed to find someone who can do it better or modify it to my liking."

The writer nodded at the answer. "Then can you make the gate rotate? I want to stand near the edge where the whirlpool splashed out and pretend that it's actually real."

"There won't be any whirlpool splashes."

"Oh, I know. It will be added as special effects."

"Alright, I'll indulge in your silly roleplay."

"That's the spirit!"

Swift typed in a command to set the gate to rotate on a timer before coming downstairs.

The two men set themselves behind a line that was the safety margin between life and death. A real gate's whirlpool has a dangerous habit to vaporize whatever was too close. Finally, the gate started rotating.

"Here it comes," Vincent Sinclair announced. "The brush of death."

Little did they know, the DHD had just registered an actual signal coming from the stargate device. The program automatically overrode the fake protocol, and reset the rotation before restarting with the actual dialing protocol.

"What's happening?" Vincent asked, confused by the reset.

"I don't know," Swift answered, just as puzzled. "It's probably a problem with the hardware or the software."

Four hundred signals were emitted by the stargate and the DHD ignored two hundred and twenty of them. Even with the DHD interpreting and reacting accordingly to the four hundred signals, preventing scenarios such as the Carter Father-Daughter Blackhole Special and time travel, the stargate was still the most dangerous device on the planet. The Alterans weren't known for safety engineering or common sense.

At least that wasn't going to be a problem this time around. No black hole was going to threaten this warehouse and the surrounding area.

Finally, after the last chevron activated, a wormhole appeared to the brief surprise of the duo standing near the gate. The telltale whirlpool splashed out, nearly engulfing the men in death.

"I THOUGHT IT DIDN'T CREATE THE WHIRLPOOL?!" the author shouted in terror and surprise.

"The fuck?" Swift can only answer.

The billionaire and the writer were then pelted with eighty kilograms of flesh, knocking them out cold.

***
**Colonel Frank Cromwell**
**A Matter of Time, 1998**

He can see the pained expression of his friend when he let go of the rope. In that singular moment, just before his death, they had reconciled. But by then it was already too late.

Meanwhile, the fall seemed entirely too slow to be real. Rather, everything seemed to be moving too slowly. Is this it?

He didn't believe in God, nor the afterlife. Yet, he joined the air force, became a special operator on the ground, and participated in some of the most dangerous operations in the Iraq war, risking life and limbs. There was a very special possibility that he will end in the ground. As far as he's concerned, that's harder than the idea of heaven and hell.

Is this really it?

There was no such thing as being good enough or bad enough. In the end, there was nothing in the absolute sense of the word.

And now, he was paying the ultimate price for his participation in the military: oblivion by black hole. He chuckled in his mind.

He supposed it was the most unique death in the whole universe.

Still, it was an honor serving his country. If he could do it all over again, he would.

Suddenly, the motion sped up rapidly.

The next thing he knew, he awoke entangled in the bodies of two other men.

United States Air Force Colonel and Gulf War veteran Frank Cromwell groaned in absolute agony, his body feeling the aftermatch of striking two men and colliding into a wooden wall.

It took a minute to register before he came to a conclusion.

He wasn't dead, but...alive? How is that possible?

Shaking off some of the pain, he struggled to find his footing on the floor. Not a surprise, as he felt dizzy and disoriented.

After several minutes, he finally got up, now being able to view his surrounding with some stability.

"Jack?!" he shouted reflexively. There was no one but the other two bodies on the ground.

But it seemed that the colonel had found himself in a movie set. There was video equipment, lighting fixtures, and the cutout of a building. Beyond the set was a vast white expanse of absolutely pristine flooring until it finally reached the white industrial walls of the warehouse.

"Where the hell am I?" Cromwell asked himself.
