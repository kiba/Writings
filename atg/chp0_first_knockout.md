He could had lost all his money, most likely either during the financial crisis, or during the dot-com crash. At age thirty five, John Swift was already a billionaire.

Swift first had made his fortune when Bitpal, an internet payment company was sold to eBUY, an online auction marketplace. From there, he could had play it safe. But he wasn't satisfied to that end.
