**John Swift**
**January, 16, 2015**

He could had lost all his money, most likely either during the financial crisis, or during the dot-com crash. At age thirty five, John Swift was already a billionaire.

Swift first had made his fortune when Bitpal, an internet payment company was sold to eBUY, an online auction marketplace. From there, he could had play it safe. But he wasn't satisfied to that end.

Among other things, he decided to invest in Eli Berkovitz's enterprises. He was a billionaire looking to become a millionaire or worse, by tackling the most difficult product categories one could think of, electric cars and rockets. Which was why everybody at at the time thought Berkovitz was crazy. By extension, everybody also thought Swift was crazy for going along with the aspiring industrialist.

Far from being overconfident and delusional, Swift knew that he would most likely lose his shirt, and would be forced to start all over again. That was OK with him.

But when the financial crisis strike in the later half of the last decade, suddenly, Berkovitz's companies were in deep trouble, and the duo's dream of routine spaceflight were in jeopardy. At that time, the Israeli-American entrepreneur has yet to successfully launch a rocket into low earth orbit, having failed three times in a row. When Berkovitz came looking for further investment, Swift, a romantic, went all in, saving the former's companies from bankruptcy.

Since then, Berkovitz delivered on his promise, and coupled with Swift's unicorn investments, Swift had became wealthier than he ever thought possible. He became celebrated in Silicon Valley and in the media at large as the Bitpal mafioso who saved Christmas and a shrewd investor.

The truth was the complete opposite, Swift wasn't the kind of super rational investor who somehow knew exactly what the future was going to be. He was a foolish man who was willing to lose all his fortune for one last shot.

Even so, for Swift, it was too much too close for comfort, failure's being a very real possibility. People failed all the time, sometime through no fault of their own rather than just not being good enough. After an almost catastrophic two thousand eight, there was still nothing like euphoria, only uncertainty about success.

Today, in two thousand sixteen, that uncertainty had largely gave way to an optimistic future. Even now, John Swift was still a romantic and a dreamer.

He drove a luxury electric sedan, a fruit of his investment, from Berkovitz Electric. He wasn't the only person in the car. Next to him was an up and incoming science fiction novelist, by the name of Vincent Sinclair, whose work Swift he had been reading as of late. The author was busily gawking at the fact that he was beside a billionaire.

The car cruised quietly to a warehouse district in Frost Point, California. It was the quintessential American city. Lot of parking lots, cars, uniform zoning, and very little in the way of public transportation and walkability, and a whole lot of other anti-features that would make a New Urbanist city planner blanche in disgust.

This was not Swift's concern. On his mind, was the production cost of two million per episodes for a rebooted science fiction series, based on historical data. A twenty six episode season would cost him at least fifty two million dollars, and that's not including license acquisition from the studio that created it, marketing, distribution, and other costs that he had accounted for.

Overall, he budgeted no greater than ninety million dollars for this project, not even a scant one percent of his overall net worth. Still, it was still a quite risky project given that he never produced a television series before. Money was no object, but he cared about putting out a good product.

"Hello? Mr. Swift?" Sinclair asked.

"Ah, sorry, I was thinking, and my driving was on autopilot," Swift answered.

The author chuckled. "That happened quite frequently to me, given that I was always swallowed up constantly by the novel that I was working on. I would drive home without the slightest idea of the route that I took. Of course, as required of me, I made sure to signal and all that. Then I would worry about the mistakes I made by reviewing the dashcam footage. It usually turned out that I didn't make any mistakes."

"You're a peculiar man, Vincent. Scared of police brutality?"

"I heard on the news frequently. It's very unfortunate. But no, I am just a worrywart. I worry about the most inconsequential thing. By the way, what are you here to show me?"

The billionaire smiled. "I knew that you are a fan of Stargate SG-1."

"Ah, yes, for all its flaws, there's not quite anything like it on television. Come to think of it, I don't even have a cable subscription."

"Me neither. I am too busy. Anyway, follow me."
