# Chapter Nine: Fruit of Intelligence

**Colonel Jack O'Neill**
**SGC, SG-Earth**
**October 23, 1998**

For this meeting, the briefing folder was thicker than usual. Usually, it was a short concise summary of what the mission will be about.

"SG-1, this is the work that was done by the analysts at the CIA," Hammond explained. "As you can see, stamped on every page, is a warning. Until the information analyzed proved themselves useful, they will be considered unreliable."

"Summary for episode sixteen, season two: SG-1..." O'Neill read the summary out loud until he reached the part where he got stuck in alien headsucker.. "What???"

"As you know, we have a CIA officer who is on the lookout on a matchup. It turned out that we have one. Your mission is to go to P3R-272, see if there's anything, and try not to get your head stuck into an unknown alien device."

"It said that we could contact the Asgard if I did get my head sucked in, sir."

"Do you want to risk your life based on that?"

O'Neill shook his head. "No, general."

Through an absolute abundance of precaution, they had a small robot delivered in from future Earth, and explored every inch of the room. Then they brought in a small radar, thermal imaging, but got absolutely nothing useful.

O'Neill made a judgement call for SG-1 to go there in person.

"Hello? We're peaceful explorer from Earth!" Doctor Jackson said. "Well, it was worth the try."

"You literally copied the dialogue," O'Neill said with a questioning tone.

"Yes, I just copied Michael Shank. It was a good idea."

"Maybe I should have you talk to the actor. How would that sound?"

"Indeed, it would very be very interesting," Teal'c concurred.

"Everyone? Let's be careful here," Carter warned.

"Right."

O'Neill slowly puttered around, stepping inside a circle.

Suddenly, an Alteran headsucker appeared.

"Step away very slowly," O'Neill said. "Let's go home."

The team made sure to stay on the side of gate as they dial home.

"I am glad that you all made it back home without dying," Hammond said. "How was your trip in the small room?"

"Alien headsucker appeared. Decided not to put my head into it," O'Neill said.
