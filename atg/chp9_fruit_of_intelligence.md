# Chapter Nine: Fruit of Intelligence

For this meeting, the briefing folder was thicker than usual. Usually, it was a short concise summary of what the mission will be about.

"SG-1, this is the work that was done by the analysts at the CIA," Hammond explained. "As you can see, stamped on every page, is a warning. Until the information analyzed proved themselves useful, they will be considered unreliable."

"Summary for episode sixteen, season two: SG-1..." O'Neill read the summary out loud until he reached the part where he got stuck in alien headsucker.. "What???"

"As you know, we have a CIA officer who is on the lookout on a matchup. It turned out that we have one. Your mission is to go to P3R-272, see if there's anything, and try not to get your head stuck into an unknown alien device."

"It said that we could contact the Asgard if I did get my head sucked in, sir."

"Do you want to risk your life based on that?"

O'Neill shook his head. "No, general."

Through an absolute abundance of precaution, they had a small robot delivered in from future Earth, and explored every inch of the room. Then they brought in a small radar, thermal imaging, but got absolutely nothing useful.

O'Neill made a judgement call for SG-1 to go there in person.

"Hello? We're peaceful explorer from Earth!" Doctor Jackson said. "Well, it was worth the try."

"You literally copied the dialogue," O'Neill said with a questioning tone.

"Yes, I just copied Michael Shank. It was a good idea."

"Maybe I should have you talk to the actor. How would that sound?"

"Indeed, it would very be very interesting," Teal'c concurred.

"Everyone? Let's be careful here," Carter warned.

"Right."

O'Neill slowly puttered around, stepping inside a circle.

Suddenly, an Alteran headsucker appeared.

"Step away very slowly," O'Neill said. "Let's go home."

The team made sure to stay on the side of gate as they dial home.

The entire team was back in the meeting room for a small debriefing section.

"I am glad that you all made it back home without dying," Hammond said. "How was your trip to this small room?"

"Alien headsucker appeared. Decided not to put my head into it," O'Neill said.

"So you followed my order regarding not dying," Hammond said. "The episode summary said it is a pivotal moment in our relation with the Asgard. Let's hope we do not regret that."

**General Jacob O'Neill**
**October 30, 1998**

It was almost unthinkable for a general to host a foreigner in his braincase, letting someone else know the deepest secret of the United States military.

Yet, after a long and protracted negotiation, unlike what was shown in the fictional series, the SGC, on behalf of the United States and the President, allowed General Jacob Carter to carrying a symbiote, against the recommendation and reservations of the majority of generals that advised the president.

It was a decision that paid off very handsomely for the SGC. The Tok'ra supplied the SGC with a steady flow of intelligence on the Goa'uld, helping the command largely avoid contact with the Goa'uld, and allowing the CIA to develop their own fledging intelligence network.

Yet, the Tok'ra and Earth spies aren't certainly everywhere.

"Welcome back, General Carter," Hammond said. "And Selmak. Are you informed about what's happening back here?"

"To some details," Carter said. "I heard you got your hand on a very valuable intelligence source? A new ally."

"It's a difficult story to believe. I can hardly believe it myself."

"I am constantly worried about what my daughter was getting up to. To be honest, I wish she stayed an astronaut. It isn't about another strange incident that SG-1 encountered?"

"Do you remembered the black hole incident?"

"Yes. It was a very unfortunate luck you have," Selmak remarked. "Some of our Tok'ra operatives wondered if your SGC was fabricating stories out of thin air."

"One of our was thought to be dead or beyond rescue," Hammond said. "Until..."

The general recounted how Frank Cromwell was recovered, details about the future, and a television series about about the fictional lives of his command, particularly half of SG-1.

"Another strange tale," Selmak said once Hammond finished his account. "You have the best and worse luck." Hammond handed Carter a thick folder.

"We have reasons to believe that the fictional account of our missions might prove useful, even with the inaccuracy. Particularly, an upcoming mission where we could capture Apophis."

Carter rapidly read through the mission details. "We don't know where Apophis is, but if by lucky coincidence, we could potentially capture him at the potential risk of angering Sokar."

"Do you know where Sokar is?"

The spymaster shook his head. "If we did, we would be able to survey his homeworld and determine his industrial capacity." Hammond frown. "If the account is true, then we would be looking at an imminent invasion not far into the future by an unusually well equipped military force. I am not necessarily worried about Sokar's forces, but it would change how Goa'uld fight wars, and that would be bad for us."

"We have to find Sokar as soon as possible, but I don't know if those documents are reliable or not. Just recently, I might had just avoided a fetal situation for Colonel O'Neill, but I don't know that to be the case since I cannot test counterfactual."

"I don't think it would strain our resource to see what if I can."

"About capturing Apophis? It seemed that it doesn't do us any good if we caught him."

"Actually, we might be able to do something there. If you got your hand on him, we could implant a subspace tracker to find Sokar's homeworld. No, the Tok'ra will handle it. I don't want any more heats on Earth than you already gotten from Apophis and others."

Carter's eyes glow. "If there are two of you, then it's more important than ever for your worlds to lie low," Selmak said.

Hammond nodded in agreement. "I'll get SG-1 in there. We'll need to plan how to do this."

"Of course."

On occasion, SG-1 would meet with the Tok'ra to plan future operations and missions, and update codebooks and challenge questions. To be clear SG-1 weren't spies, and certainly wouldn't need to do this if General Carter already convened with Hammond, but the Tok'ra were convinced of the importance of tracing Sokar, so they set up the meeting anyway according to the already planned addresses, in the hope of catching Apophis. Beside, it was also a chance to practice intergalatic diplomacy.

O'Neill wasn't sure that reality would play out the same way. It might be that the butterfly effect had already changed things, or that the intelligence was simply wrong.

Nonetheless, he was here instead of somewhere safer. Part of SG-1 and SG-2 were lying low in a concealed position and well camouflaged. They lied behind the gate, while the Tok'ra snatch team waited closer to the probable crash site. This way, if anybody comes out of the gate, they will be shot behind. Doctor Jackson and Carter sat out this mission, because this was more of a direct action mission than the missions that SG-1 typically do.

Luckily, he heard a loud whine. This is it.

The Tok'ra and the Earthlings watched a dogfight in the sky, cumulating with a crash of one fighter. But it wasn't safe just yet.

Every MANPAD activated their missiles. The missiles streak toward its target one of the missile exploded against the hull of the death glider. It crashed too far from here.

The tok'ra wasted no time rushing toward their probable target.

Meanwhile, one SGC member rushed toward the console. He dialed the gate with practiced ease.

Once the gate started rotating, the SG teams abandoned their position, and took prepared defensive position.

"Signal acquired," Teal'c acknowledged the subspace receiver, which was receiving telemetry.

The Tok'ra ran toward the gate. The GDO were dialed in, and both team rushed home.

A nearby Al'kesh, set up for secondary and tertiary extraction point, lift off before turning invisible.

With no passengers, the Al'Kesh started tracking the target, while also keeping an eye on the Goa'uld mothership. As long as the enemy were obessed with capturing Apophis and torturing him, they should be able to track the system lord toward Sokar's homeworld.

The teams picked up the remaining teammates at the primary extraction point, then dialed two more prearranged gates before arriving on a jungle planet.

It was a tremendous abundance of caution in the case that the Sokar was smarter or more paranoid than he was anticipated to be.

The Tok'ra and Earthlings navigated their way to a cave, before teleporting themselves into the underground complex. It was the typical Tok'ra base, with blue crystalline walls generated by Tok'ra tunneling crystals.

"You all arrived safely," Selmak said, as the team were surrounded by Zat and guns, which were thankfully not aimed at them. "No infection as well. I assumed everything went well?" Another person, a medic, began checking the neck from behind for secondary confirmation.

"Affirmative, general," O'Neill said, smiling at an operation that had gone very smoothly. "Though I don't know if we accomplished our primary objective."

"I can confirm that with the video footage," Martouf said, referring to the combat cams that everyone had mounted.

Everyone gathered around a flatscreen as the Martouf's combat footage played.

The Tok'ra wasted no time in conversing with the system lord. Instead, the agent injected the subspace tracker into the host's arm as quickly as he could, ignoring the cry of the Goa'uld.

"Apophis begged for sanctuary," Doctor Jackson translated the agonizing words. In the video, Martouf injected the Goa'uld again with a syringe before putting it away.

"I hope that everything go right," Martouf said. "I fear that the chemical was not delivered properly."

"It is a calculated gamble," Selmak said. "Only time will tell if we got him."

Hammond has very mixed feeling about this. The operation and the covert reconnaissance went just as planned and that everyone made it back alive.

The pictures taken by the Tok'ra painted a very dire picture.

"They are not like the fictional account," Hammond said. "It's even worse."

"It is in the neck of time that we uncovered this information," Selmak said.
