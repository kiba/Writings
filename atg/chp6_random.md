It was easy to capture a staff weapon and one of the first thing that SGC captured. Jaffa died in drove when confronted against a tactically superior foe with superior weapons.

A staff weapon was a terrible design in more way than one, more of a tool used to terrorize slaves than to fight actual ground battles. The trigger assembly was a button that you press, instead of a trigger you pull. There's no way you can held the staff weapon against your shoulder plate, unless you have long enough arm, which affect the staff's accuracy by letting the recoil shake the weapon.

Nonetheless, it was studied and taken apart by researchers to see how it work, as it was an example of actual energy weapon.

It had been weeks since Doctor Lee was at area fifty-one. Previously, he set up a rig for testing rig for testing how long a staff weapon might last.

Now, he was at the range again, still hearing the tell-tale sign of the staff weapon firing.

"How long it had been fired?" he asked one of the range officer.

"Since you left."

"What?"

"Yeah, you have to see it to believe it. It's extremely reliable. Our problem has more to do with keeping personnel alert and not complacent."

Lee could see the scorches that was made into the side of a hill. It hadn't penetrated at all, but the side of the hill was basically blasted repeatly into glasses.

"This is great!" Lee said with excitement.

The staff weapon project was an idea of low priority, especially SGC had since discovered juicier alien technology to reverse engineer. Lee still checked in from time to time.
