This civilization didn't speak English, nor does it speaks Goa'uld, the current Lingua Franca of the galaxy at large, nor Alteran Latin, the language of the gatebuilder.

It would be convenient if they did spoke English like they did in fictionalized history of the SGC, but wishful thinking wasn't going to help SGC.

Doctor Jackson and his team will have to figure it out even as a man from the other side helpfully input information to help with the translation.

Radio wave of musics and speech streamed into the rover's hard drive, ready to be downloaded on the next connection, but the amount of overwhelming information with almost no context wouldn't be helpful at this stage.

The only thing that General Hammond could do but was work through his paperwork as if nothing happened. Yes, there were a furry activities as SGC prepared for first contact. Missions were canceled, team members were pulled and reassigned, and jobs and projects were rescheduled and re-prioritized.

But ultimately, Hammond can't make a decision if they can't communicate.

There could be a number of things happening on the other side. Maybe they were on the verge of nuclear war because of how first contact happened.
Maybe it would be the unifying event for them.

Whatever the case may be, Hammond continued his triage against paperworks in the absence of actionable intelligence, the bane of all generals.

Doctor Jackson did great work, there was no doubt about that. But Hammond wasn't an expert. He didn't know if three days was a miracle of genius or just hard work, not that it matters.

But Hammond was forced in a role in which he was a diplomat, politician, spymaster, and soldier at the same time. It would be nice to know more, as Hammond was often out of his depth. It's a good thing that he has Jackson acting as his diplomatic expertise, even without formal training.

"So, what do we know?" Hammond asked the archaeologist. Also present was the rest of SG-1, and some scientists from Jackson's translation and culture team.

"What we do know is that they seems to match the planetary civilization known as Langara in SG-1, episode 21 season five, in which I was slated to die of radiation poisoning and ascend to a higher plane of existence."

His heart dropped like a stone.

Nuclear war and Armageddon danced like wildfire in his imagination, not on his planet, but somewhere else. Everyone else seemed to also share the same look of concern.

"Tell us more about Langara," Hammond said.

"Ah, yes. We confirmed from our suspicion that there are three superpowers on this planet, and that their technological level...."

There wasn't a whole lot of things to know about Langara in the first place, and the RPG materials wasn't as solid as they hoped. What do they eat and drink? What is their religious beliefs? What are the main political ideologies? All of them are unanswered.

Hammond watched as SG-1 prepared to step into the horizon.

"Colonel O'Neill, make sure Doctor Jackson don't die!" he shouted in jest.

"Will do!" O'Neill responded.

Hammond's discomfort continued.


It was an important planet that they will be traveling to. It was a relatively sophisticated civilization only decades behind. They could be an ally. Also important was the strategic materials located on that planet.  Though, with a captured Goa'uld mothership, the strategic importance of Langara was less urgent.

However, there was still the fact that Langara was possibly a planet on the brink of war and that SG-1 might be caught in the crossfire.

How many time did SGC have to rescue SG-1 now? When will the stream of bad luck end?

Going through the stargates was just like walking from one room to another.

But no matter how many time O'Neill went through a stargate, it never was quite routine. He supposed the wonder stayed with them.

In any case, as per protocol, they walked to a FOB, and then to Langara proper, which took a total of two dials.

The team arrived in a building, as expected, but it seemed that it was moved to somewhere other than the museum. It had the look of a bunker, with dreary gray color and strut of exposed steels.

A group of Langarians was waiting, or rather, the Kelownans.

Already, Jackson was on the double, starting to greet them in their language.

The man he knew from fiction, Doctor Jonas Quinn responded animatedly to what Doctor Jackson had spoken.

There were other translators in the group, but not SG-1 proper. It was hard enough to learn Goa'uld and Alteran Latin. They don't need to spend their time learning one of the Langarian language.

But it was necessary that somebody was there to provide the translation, as Doctor Jackson was as good as any. To have a doctor degree in linguistic was one thing, it was quite another to have someone who was essentially a savant polyglot. He could be on a television series about his language ability, but it seemed fame eluded the archaeologist.

"What now?" he asked the good doctor.

"We're supposed to follow them."

"Ask them why are the other two representatives aren't present. Otherwise, we're not moving a single step."

The prospect of nuclear war was on O'Neill's mind, especially given recent history, and the knowledge that was provided through the show.

That was where national representation from each of the three states came in. If they refused, they wouldn't be meeting. But the political and diplomatic eggheads thought it might backfire, though the situation was already dicey to begin with.

O'Neill felt slightly hypocritical, but he knew that the situation wasn't the same. The Russians wouldn't be insane enough to go ballistic. They knew what the stakes were, but the Langarians might not.

After several minutes of animated talking between the two parties, the aliens' number slightly reduced. Maybe they were relaying information outside the building.

"Look like they finally agreed," Doctor Jackson said.

"Good. If they keep lying, we'll go back."

The scientist nodded in acknowledgement.

Seven hours later

The Kelnownan charm offensive against SG-1 failed, and the ended up backpedaling quickly, bringing the other two powers into play. Now the team was in full view of envoys from the three nation-states or superpower on this planet.

They sat around in a semi-circle on a white table with the flag of three nations of this world behind them. There were twelve of them, and all looked middle aged or older.

"Greeting, I am Colonel Jack O'Neill, leader of SG-1 and this expedition," he said while Jackson translated for him. "However, we are not proper ambassadors or diplomats, but rather explorers. We hope to set up an official agreement for a full true meeting to come. As a token of goodwill, I came bearing gifts. "

Objects from a 21st century Earth were rolled out by the shelfload in front of the envoys.

"These are artifacts, a showcase of our mastery of technology and science," O'Neill narrated. "While they are toys to us, they were also samples of the current state of our civilization's technologies. We made sure that there is a pair for each nation for each planet. One for you to admire and observe, the other for your study."

The room was silent as the artifacts were passed around the table. So far so good.

The rest of the meeting was a series of small pleasantries and exchanges of information.

In other words, it was boring.

But like they always say, boring was good.

One hour later

SG-1 could feel the intensity of the atmosphere as they left for the hotel that was set aside them.

They were escorted into vehicles and watched by Kelnownan guards.

Suffice to say, they knew that the nation they were in held all the advantages. They were subjected to the sight and sounds of their culture, as well as their stargate.

This was going to agitate the other superpowers no matter how impartial SG-1 tried to be.

"O'Neill?" Jackson prompted.

"Yes, Daniel?"

"I talked to them about nukes, all of them in private," he said. "They want to know."

"Of course they do, and I agreed we should give them at some point the ability to make nukes and the ability to deliver them. It's crucial to the defense of this planet."

"But they might nuke themselves."

"I agree. If they are to be useful ally, it's crucial that they do not kill themselves off."

"But as you said in the show, nuclear weapon will not give them peace until they use it, at least once. If they don't have rocket technologies, though, they can't destroy their entire civilization."

"But it will weaken them as an ally against the Goa'uld. A city's destroyed is a city worth of GDP, intellectual and military manpower." Everyone at SGC knew they need allies, and at first glance, it seemed that the Langarians aren't anything like North Korea or worse, Saudi Arabia.
