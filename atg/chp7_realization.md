# Chapter Seven: Realization

***
**FBI Special Agent Madison Smith**
**October 15, 2015**
**FBI Crime Lab**

They gotten nowhere with the interrogation of a criminal who is both an impersonator and a thief. Even from fingerprint and face recognition, they still don't know the criminal's real name. Yes, he claimed to be a diplomat named Gerry Parkinson, but that diplomat was working in China. Her partner, Daniel Fox decided to humor him to throw the person off his game by agreeing to a DNA test.

A whitecoat lab technician came out of the genetic lab that Special Agent Madison Smith was standing outside. "Special Agent Madison Smith?" the technician called for her.

"I am that person. What do you have for me?" she said, awaiting the result.

"We have a problem. Both DNA samples match. I had to redo and check over my steps three times, yet I still got the same results."

"We're talking about the diplomat and our suspect?" The lab technician nodded.

"We can't distinguish between them."

Smith raised her eyebrows at the unexpected news. It also played into the impersonator's fabricated narrative. She could imagine his glee and laughter for having fooled the lab.

"Alright, let's enumerate the possibility here. We might have mixed up the blood vials, or that the impersonator is the diplomat's secret twin, or that our suspect is telling the truth."

"The blood vials were received at different time from different locations. I checked the video footage to make sure that I didn't get them mixed up."

"Then we'll need to check it again," Smith concluded. "Failing that, we may need to launch a bigger investigation. It might be possible that someone intercepted and swapped it out."If that wasn't the case, then it was likely that the impersonator was a long lost identical twin of the diplomat.

**Agent Daniel Fox**

Fox was starting to despise this job. He was interrogating the same prisoner only to get garbage information about some sci-fi fantasy.

"Don't you ever get sick of this?" the criminal said, sounding just as sick of the game himself.

"A call just came in. My partner said that the DNA match was not a match," he lied to the criminal.

"A lie. You can tell me whatever you want in an interrogation. I was trained for that before I come here. It wouldn't work anyway, because I am telling you only the truth."

Fox was rather unnerved by the man's ability to keep to his story. He almost believed it even.

"Even if there is a match, there are far more  plausible theories than what you proposed."

The fake diplomat snorted. "I know this was going to happen."

"Your lies is getting thin."

"I'll tell you more if somebody from the state department talks to me."

A phone rang. "Excuse me," Fox said before he walked out of the interrogation room.

It didn't take long. Fox's boss told him something very interesting on the phone, which made him more puzzled than ever.

Not only it was classified documents that this impersonator stolen, but top secret documents critical to national security. Daniel Fox wouldn't still get access to those documents, but it sounded like the State department is very worried.

They're sending somebody to talk to the criminal.

Damn it. Every time he got closer and closer to the truth, it played right into the impersonator's hand. Now the fake diplomat was getting what he wanted, an audience with the department of state.

**Gerry Parkinson**

If nothing happened, Parkinson would need to wait at least a week before SGC enacts their contingency plan. Meanwhile, Parkinson was forced to wait in a jail cell inside the military base.

It was not a surprise. He went into this mission knowing what could happen, and he did a three day stays in a simulated jail with simulated guards to understand the consequence. It was not the most pleasant experience.

He was more worried about convincing the FBI, which in any other situation, would wisely believe that he wasn't who he said he was.

The only entertainment he has access to was the twenty-four hours news, which was always showing coverage of the election, and a clown of a presidential candidate. They're serious contemplating to elect a real estate mogul and give him access to nuclear weapons, and by extension the Stargate? This is lunacy.

"You have a visitor," the guard said.

Parkinson grudgingly put out his hands to be handcuffed, before they open up the door, and then escorted to a interrogation room.

To his happy surprise, he sat down to confront a man who wasn't from the FBI. It was the Secretary of State himself. He knew him as a senator from North Carolina back on his Earth.

"So, you're quite the mystery man," the secretary of state said. "Explain to me how you obtained information."

"I have been authorized by my government to release those information to prove that I am something worth talking about," Parkinson answered.

"By release, you mean leaking classified information from seventeen years ago and earlier? I am sure that one person can't do it alone. WHat's your motive?"

"It is a risk," Parkinson admitted, completely ignoring the accusation. "But a necessary one."

"Like the FBI agent right beside me, I don't believe you," the secretary bluntly said. "Your story is completely absurd. It's more likely that you simply stole it."

"If I were in your position, then I would think the same thing, yes. Since you're here, I am now authorized to prove my story once for all. I am sure you understand the importance of secrecy here."

"Another one of you rabbit hole?"

"I assure you, it's the real thing."

"This is your last chance to come clean and rat out your associate," Fox warned. "Your complete failure to cooperate will be duly noted by the court."

"There are no lies for you to dig through, Fox," Parkinson said in annoyance.

Then Parkinson spilt the GPS coordinate of the warehouse that housed the stargate. It was located in a conveniently deserted industrial zone.

**The President**
**White House, Infopunk-Earth**

Someone has stolen still-classified materials seventeen years ago. The president don't know where and how, but he knew that a man in Nevada was responsible for it. This man also told the FBI team and the secretary of state where to find the next clue.

Eventually, that led the FBI director to order a secret raid on an abandoned warehouse. The criminals were at least courteous enough to choose an out-of-way location.

"Are we walking into a trap?" he wondered out loud to the people in the room. "What do we know?"

"We know that our sole contact has a DNA match with one of our diplomat, Gerry Parkinson," an FBI agent on the case informed. "He also claimed to be Gerry Parkinson himself and knew in details secret personal details of the diplomat wife. He also possessed highly classified materials from seventeen years ago. It's all consistent with his narrative."

"We knew absolutely nothing beyond what he wanted to tell us," another one of his advisor concluded.

The president rubbed his head. "We'll continue with the operation. See if we find out."

Everyone, including the president, munched on their pizza, as they watched via satellite communication, conducted the raid.

The FBI squads went through each room methodically, finding absolutely nothing, but it didn't take long to find the center.

There it was, a ring like structure in the middle of the warehouse. In front of it was a robot with an iPad mounted on it, bearing much resemblance to a particular Martian rover.

"What the hell is that?" Agent Fox said.

"This is Gerry Parkinson speaking," a recorded message by a certain impersonator played out. "It looked like you have entered the warehouse. The stargate is set to trigger in thirty seconds. Please clear away from the stargate, as it is dangerous...."

"Everyone out!" Agent Fox said in a panic, leaving all but a quadropter drone behind.

Nothing happened. There was no bomb, but the gate triggered, rotating.

"What in the world?" the president said. The most unexpected thing happen. It was just like a scene from a television series.

"It's....a stargate."

Another robot rolled out. This robot didn't like a bit like Curiosity and it was ugly as hell. It also held up another iPad.

The iPad turned on, showing a very familiar face.

"Hello? Testing, testing. To whom am I speaking?" O'Neill said. "Why the hell is this place empty?"

Everyone was speechless.

"I think we are in an episode of Stargate SG-1," the most powerful man in the world said.

***

It was disturbing to the president. The other Earth has penetrated this society for a few weeks, suborned a billionaire, and clandestinely gathered intelligence on his United States.

They were presumably friendly, but it dawn on him that other more hostile powers might be capable of doing the same.

"General Hammond," the president greeted on a secure encrypted channel. "I am sorry we haven't met under better circumstance."

"No problem, Mr. President. We anticipated this problem in our planning. "

**Madison Smith**
**Fox's Residence, Infopunk-Earth**
**November 15, 2015**

Daniel Fox hadn't been himself lately. The whole stargate business and the wild goose chase had upset his worldview of a rational universe. Madison Smith didn't believe that the rational universe was shattered. On the contrary, she found the SGC far more rational and sober than its television counterpart.

Fox was so broken that her superior decided to put him on a paid leave for two months. When he didn't update his facebook or his other social media page, Madison became increasingly worried.

Now, she was ringing the doorbell of her partner's home.

After several seconds, the door finally opened up to a very disheveled looking man still in his bathrobe.

"I have donuts and hot coffee," she said, smiling without skipping a beat.

"Come in," he said.

Once they were in the living room, Fox asked, "Is the stargate still real? Am I not delusional?"

Smith shook her head. "No, it's still very real."

Fox collapsed into his couch. "It can't be."

"We have to face reality for what it is rather than what we think it should be," she quoted someone.

"You're right...I guess.

**Gerry Parkinson**
**SGC, Stargate-Earth**

Parkinson didn't want to repeat the experience of being incarcerated against his will and being told repeatedly that he was a liar. He supposed it was his luck that he wasn't captured by the Goa'uld rather than the FBI. The sadistic snakes love to use torture even when it wasn't the best way to extract information.

"Mr. Parkinson, I thank you a job well done," Hammond said. "Your work is a credit to the nation."

"It is a job that you asked me to do, General," Parkinson replied.

"Did you get talk to a counselor yet?"

"I am....working through my issues."

"You looked tired, Parkinson. I supposed I should grant you a reprieve. You're free to do nothing for three days. Even use up some of your vacation time. I would recommend you to talk to your family. We have a lot of work when you're ready to jump back in."

"Yes, sir."

Hopefully, there will be no more 'interesting' mission for him to do.

***
**Area 51, Infopunk-Earth**

The gate, once verified as a genuine technological artifact, was moved by a non-descript semitruck to its new home. Thankfully, nobody in the media noticed anything leading up to, during, or after the event.
