# Chapter Seven: Realization

***
**FBI Special Agent Madison Smith**
**October 15, 2015**
**FBI Crime Lab**

They had gotten nowhere with the interrogation of an impersonator and thief, the man who called himself Gerry Parkinson. Her partner, Daniel Smith decided to humor him at least once to throw the liar off his game for once.

A whitecoat lab technician came out of the genetic lab that Special Agent Madison Smith was standing outside. "Agent Smith?" the technician called for her.

"I am agent Smith. What do you have for me?" she said, awaiting the result.

"We have a problem. Both DNA samples match. I had to redo and check over my steps three times, yet I still got the same results."

"We're talking about the diplomat and our suspect?"

"We can't distinguish between them."

Smith raised her eyebrows at the unexpected news. It also played into the narrative of the impersonator, which was what he wanted.

"Alright, let's enumerate the possibility here. We might have mixed up the blood vials, or that the impersonator is the diplomat's secret twin, or that our suspect is telling the truth."

"The blood vials were received at different time from different locations. I checked the video footage."

"Then we'll need to check it again," Smith concluded. "Failing that, we may need to launch a bigger investigation. It might be possible that someone intercepted and swapped it out." It was a long short, she had to admit, as it was more likely that the impersonator is in fact the diplomat's long lost twin.

**Agent Daniel Fox**

Here he was again, interrogating the same prisoner all over again.

"Don't you ever get sick of this?" the criminal said, sounding just as sick of the game himself.

"My partner came in and confirmed that your DNA sample matched our diplomat. I am curious as to why this is."

"Do you believe my story now?"

"No, there are other more plausible theories than what you proposed."

The fake diplomat snorted. "I know this was going to happen."

"Your lies is getting thin."

"I'll tell you more if somebody from the state department talks to me."

A phone rang. "Excuse me," Fox said before he walked out of the interrogation room.

It didn't take long. Fox's boss told him something very interesting on the phone, which made him more puzzled than ever.

Not only it was classified documents that this impersonator stolen, but top secret documents critical to national security. Daniel Fox wouldn't still get access to those documents, but it sounded like the State department is very worried.

They're sending somebody out to talk to the criminal.

Damn it. Every time he got closer and closer to the truth, it played right into the impersonator's hand. Now the fake diplomat was getting what he wanted, an audience with a state official.
