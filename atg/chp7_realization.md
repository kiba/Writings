# Chapter Seven: Realization

***
**FBI Special Agent Madison Smith**
**October 15, 2015**
**FBI Crime Lab**

They had gotten nowhere with the interrogation of an impersonator and thief, the man who called himself Gerry Parkinson. Her partner, Daniel Smith decided to humor him at least once to throw the liar off his game for once.

A whitecoat lab technician came out of the genetic lab that Special Agent Madison Smith was standing outside. "Agent Smith?" the technician called for her.

"I am agent Smith. What do you have for me?" she said, awaiting the result.

"We have a problem. Both DNA samples match. I had to redo and check over my steps three times, yet I still got the same results."

"We're talking about the diplomat and our suspect?"

"We can't distinguish between them."

Smith raised her eyebrows at the unexpected news. It also played into the narrative of the impersonator, which was what he wanted.

"Alright, let's enumerate the possibility here. We might have mixed up the blood vials, or that the impersonator is the diplomat's secret twin, or that our suspect is telling the truth."

"The blood vials were received at different time from different locations. I checked the video footage."

"Then we'll need to check it again," Smith concluded. "Failing that, we may need to launch a bigger investigation. It might be possible that someone intercepted and swapped it out." It was a long short, she had to admit, as it was more likely that the impersonator is in fact the diplomat's long lost twin.

**Agent Daniel Fox**

Here he was again, interrogating the same prisoner all over again.

"Don't you ever get sick of this?" the criminal said, sounding just as sick of the game himself.

"My partner came in and confirmed that your DNA sample matched our diplomat. I am curious as to why this is."

"Do you believe my story now?"

"No, there are other more plausible theories than what you proposed."

The fake diplomat snorted. "I know this was going to happen."

"Your lies is getting thin."

"I'll tell you more if somebody from the state department talks to me."

A phone rang. "Excuse me," Fox said before he walked out of the interrogation room.

It didn't take long. Fox's boss told him something very interesting on the phone, which made him more puzzled than ever.

Not only it was classified documents that this impersonator stolen, but top secret documents critical to national security. Daniel Fox wouldn't still get access to those documents, but it sounded like the State department is very worried.

They're sending somebody out to talk to the criminal.

Damn it. Every time he got closer and closer to the truth, it played right into the impersonator's hand. Now the fake diplomat was getting what he wanted, an audience with a state official.

**Gerry Parkinson**

If nothing happened, Parkinson would need to wait at least a week before SGC enacts their contingency plan. Meanwhile, Parkinson was forced to wait in a jail cell inside the military base.

It was not a surprise. He went into this mission knowing what could happen, and he did a three day stays in a simulated jail to understand the consequence.

He was more worried about convincing the FBI, which in any other situation, would wisely believe that he wasn't who Parkinson said he was.

The only entertainment he has access to was the twenty-four hours news, which was always showing one more negative event after another.

"You have a visitor," the guard said.

To his happy surprise, he sat down to confront a man who wasn't from the FBI. It was the Secretary of State. Gerry Parkinson knew that man and every senior members of the President's administration.

"So, you're quite the mystery man," the secretary of state said. "Explain to me how you obtained information."

"I have been authorized by my government to release those information to prove that I am something worth talking about," Parkinson answered.

"By release, you mean leaking classified information from seventeen years ago and earlier."

"It is a risk," Parkinson admitted. "But a necessary one."

"Like the FBI agent right beside me, I don't believe you," the secretary bluntly said.

"Now that you're here, I can give you information that would prove my story."

"Another one of you rabbit hole?"

"It's the real thing.."

"Just to be clear, if you tricked us, we will throw the book at you, and any one of your associate," Fox warned.

"Let's get this over with, shall we?" the secretary said.

Gerry Parkinson spilled out the address of the gate location, and how to get there.

**The President**
**White House, Infopunk-Earth**

Someone has stolen still-classified materials seventeen years ago. The president don't know where and how, but he knew that a man in Nevada was responsible for it. This man also told the FBI team and the screctary of state where to find such information.
