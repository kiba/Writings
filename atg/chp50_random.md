**Colonel Frank Cromwell**
**Swift's residence, Infopunk-Earth**

With all fifty thousand dollars spent, there was nothing for the colonel to do procurement wise. Still, that didn't prevent researchers from sending him impassioned flee to purchase this or that. Truth be said, laboratory equipment can get really expensive, and fifty thousand dollars can only buy so much.

Swift wasn't that generous, although he acknowledge that stargate program needed everything it can get. It wasn't that urgent, he said. Once the deal on the other side of the gate was held up, he will do everything he can help both Earth.

Recently, SGC sent just one personnel over, an anthropologist, to stay at Swift's residence. Cromwell no longer have to answer questions from Jackson's department. It was her job now.

Still, Cromwell found other things to occupy his mind with. Like how the hell a presumably fictional device end up being real in Swift's universe? That was one of Cromwell's responsibility when he discussed his new job with Hammond.

"What does he look like?" Cromwell asked the billionaire.

"Well..ummm..I am drawing a blank," Swift said.

Cromwell groaned in frustration. Every lead or receipt ended up with nothing. There was absolutely no proof. Yet, he felt that Swift wasn't lying. Something or somebody put the stargate there, whether that was in the deep past or just recently.

"So not only you don't know what his name is, but you don't know what he look like either."

"I swear! I know!" Swift protested.

"Look, I believe you. But right now, there's some sort of black hole regarding any documentation on the stargate device, but there's documentation for everything."

"So what's next then?"

"I don't know. An MRI? Somebody might messed with your brain."

Swift didn't look a bit happy about that. "I dislike the idea of someone noodling around my brain and my life."

"Somebody already did with your life. I am just trying to help you out. Otherwise, if we can't find anything on this device, it might as well an act of god."

"From the ascended beings? Connecting a gate to another reality?"

"It may be well 'God did it' is the answer, but I would like to see evidence for that."

The billionaire was sitting in Fraiser's clinic in a medical grown. He wasn't sick, but Cromwell wanted him assessed. That included psychological testing as well to rule out any anomaly.

"I am afraid that I can't find an anomaly," Fraiser said. "He got a clean bill of health, and the psychologist said that he's sound of mind as far as he can tell."

"So no clues why I am blanking the seller of the stargate?" John Swift asked.

Fraiser shook her head. "I wish I know."

One of the perk of being a researcher at the most top secret military program in the world is that one is afforded leeway and privileges in order to do a job, like being able to piggybacking on a military plane to fly to other top secret locations. Services on such plane is predictably bad, but it beats waiting in line and getting stuffed like sardine into a plane.

That was how Bill Lee arrived in the legendary Area 51, where supposedly Roswell aliens has landed. He stumbled out of the aircraft along with top secret cargos onto the desert. Predictably, it was scorchingly hot. He hurried to the building where he supposed to be.

After checking in, and walking to another building in the scorching heat, he finally arrived at the testing range.

It was easy to capture a staff weapon and one of the first thing that SGC captured. Jaffa died in drove when confronted against a tactically superior foe with superior weapons.

A staff weapon was a terrible design in more way than one, more of a tool used to terrorize slaves than to fight actual ground battles. The trigger assembly was a button that you press, instead of a trigger you pull. There's no way you can held the staff weapon against your shoulder plate, unless you have long enough arm, which affect the staff's accuracy by letting the recoil shake the weapon.

Nonetheless, it was studied and taken apart by researchers to see how it work, as it was an example of actual energy weapon.

It had been weeks since Doctor Lee was at area fifty-one. Previously, he set up a rig for testing rig for testing how long a staff weapon might last.

Now, he was at the range again, still hearing the tell-tale sign of the staff weapon firing.

"How long it had been fired?" he asked one of the range officer.

"Since you left."

"What?"

"Yeah, you have to see it to believe it. It's extremely reliable. Our problem has more to do with keeping personnel alert and not complacent."

Lee could see the scorches that was made into the side of a hill. It hadn't penetrated at all, but the side of the hill was basically blasted repeatedly into glasses.

"This is great!" Lee said with excitement.

The staff weapon project was an idea of low priority, especially SGC had since discovered juicier alien technology to reverse engineer. Lee still checked in from time to time.

**White House, Infopunk-Earth**

The president was awaken in the middle of the night by his chief of staff. When you are already in one of the most stressful job in the world, the job find even more ways to add to the stress. He dressed up as fast as soon possible, beckoning for his wife to return to her sleep.

Outside the door, he met with his military chief of staff. Then he was briefed with the latest news.

"Excuse me?" the president said. "Is this some kind of joke?"

The general gravely shook his head. "No, Mr. President. It's very real. It's either that, or that somehow an elaborate prank has been perpetuated on whitehouse staff."

The president played a video on an ipad, showing what was supposed to be fictional an actual reality. A machine came through, as if appearing from thin air. An ipad was mounted on the machine, showing the face of Colonel O'Neill.

"Alright, I am not going take your word for it," the president said.

"You shouldn't, but we should be prepared for both possibility it's real or that it's a complete hoax. I should be able to come up with options."

"Is this an emergency?"

"Possible. We don't know yet."

"Then I want to be up in the air as soon as possible."

"We need a coverup story as well. A readiness exercise? It won't make people panic, but the Russians might be alarmed, but only the slighest bit. "

"Let's do it then."

The president and his family were immediately transported to a 747 in the middle of the night in anticipation of possible world-changing crisis.
