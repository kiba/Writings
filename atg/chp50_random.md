One of the perk of being a researcher at the most top secret military program in the world is that one is afforded leeway and privileges in order to do a job, like being able to piggybacking on a military plane to fly to other top secret locations. Services on such plane is predictably bad, but it beats waiting in line and getting stuffed like sardine into a plane.

That was how Bill Lee arrived in the legendary Area 51, where supposedly Roswell aliens has landed. He stumbled out of the aircraft along with top secret cargos onto the desert. Predictably, it was scorchingly hot. He hurried to the building where he supposed to be.

After checking in, and walking to another building in the scorching heat, he finally arrived at the testing range.

It was easy to capture a staff weapon and one of the first thing that SGC captured. Jaffa died in drove when confronted against a tactically superior foe with superior weapons.

A staff weapon was a terrible design in more way than one, more of a tool used to terrorize slaves than to fight actual ground battles. The trigger assembly was a button that you press, instead of a trigger you pull. There's no way you can held the staff weapon against your shoulder plate, unless you have long enough arm, which affect the staff's accuracy by letting the recoil shake the weapon.

Nonetheless, it was studied and taken apart by researchers to see how it work, as it was an example of actual energy weapon.

It had been weeks since Doctor Lee was at area fifty-one. Previously, he set up a rig for testing rig for testing how long a staff weapon might last.

Now, he was at the range again, still hearing the tell-tale sign of the staff weapon firing.

"How long it had been fired?" he asked one of the range officer.

"Since you left."

"What?"

"Yeah, you have to see it to believe it. It's extremely reliable. Our problem has more to do with keeping personnel alert and not complacent."

Lee could see the scorches that was made into the side of a hill. It hadn't penetrated at all, but the side of the hill was basically blasted repeatedly into glasses.

"This is great!" Lee said with excitement.

The staff weapon project was an idea of low priority, especially SGC had since discovered juicier alien technology to reverse engineer. Lee still checked in from time to time.

**Colonel Jack O'Neill**
**Whitehouse, Infopunk-Earth**

O'Neill never thought he will end up having dinner with the future President of the United States. On second thought, the butterfly effect might make it so that the African American politician would never become president.

On this Earth, O'Neill was practically a household name. Granted, his television self did too many stupid things to count, but that was why he's in the white house, instead of back at the SGC.

**Doctor Samantha Carter**
**October 5, 1998**

Seven years ago, she was a fighter pilot annihilating her enemies from afar, bombing enemy vehicles and installations alike. Sometime she would watch people flee from the burning wrecks. More often, she moved on to other targets, and launched further attack to deny the Iraqi their equipment and ability to fight.

Anti-air defenses and potential air engagements kept her cautious, and from being too complacent. It was a one-sided war, but it was still a war she experienced. It may not be direct and personal, but she still saw the aftermath of the brutality she dished out. She imagined people dying and burning in flame,

Only after her tour of duty in the gulf war did she imagined those men as husbands, brothers, and fathers, maybe someone like her own father or brother, and hundred of them, if not thousands.

They left behind families, because she pulled the trigger, because the military she was part of decided to mobilize to fight in this war, because her commander-in-chief decided that the invasion cannot stand, because a dictator felt that he has free reign to invade a country.

In the end, she is a killer, an instrument of destruction directed at her country's enemies.

Carter did not quit back then, nor did she apologize, but she did change her career trajectory.

She stopped flying and went into theoretical physics. It took her to the stargate project, and then to SG-1, the flagship exploration team.

SG-1's mission was to peacefully explore the cosmos, looking for ally and technology to defend Earth. Of course, Carter found herself in too many harrowing firefights against horde of Jaffa, slave soldiers of the various Goa'uld system lords, adding her death toll.

Once again, she did not apologize for creating many more weeping sets of parents.
