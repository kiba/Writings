**Diplomat Gerry Parkinson**
**Season One, Post-Episode Thirteen Season One**


The framers of the Constitution would had never guessed for the need to make treaties with powers in the stars, or its total secrecy, or the fact that the senate wasn't going to vote on any of those treaties. That was largely up to the SGC's discretion. Those were swept under the rug under terms like "executive agreements" and other weasel terms.

Somehow that didn't feel all that egregious to diplomat Gerry Parkinson. For sure, he was a participant in this himself, especially as he walked across a moon to meet with the leader of an amphibious species, the Ohnes.

Accompanying him was Doctor Daniel Jackson himself, who found himself a victim of a misunderstanding. More importantly, Jackson was the leading expert on alien cultures. To many in the galaxy, he was the face of Earth, not the diplomatic corp. Thankfully, he was a pretty good diplomat himself.

"So, the Nem guy is the," Parkinson tried to refresh his memory. "The guy who kidnapped you and almost killed you."

"That's right. He's going to be present to make his offer of reparation to me," Jackson answered.

"The guy with the crown, that's the king, right?"

"That's the best I can put it, yes."

They continued this conversation until they reached the meeting table.

Despite the fact that it was a first contact situation, this wasn't the first time that the Ohnes interacted with humanity. One of their own, Omoroca, helped foster a rebellion on Earth against the system lord Belus. Four thousand years later, Omoroca's mate, Nem faked Jackson's death.

Now, on the other side of the table, Nem was there.

"Hello, my name is Gerry Parkinson, a diplomat of the United States of America. I come here to negotiate an alliance with you against the Goa'uld."

Ambassador Joesph Faxon was a fictional character to the alternate reality United States. However, Parkinson wasn't a character in "Stargate SG-1" or any other franchise. That was a huge factor in selection, because it was less likely that they would reject him as a fraud, scammer, or a crackpot.

Another important consideration was the fact that Gerry Parkinson existed in the other reality, seventeen years older, doing Parkinson's job.

Of course, Parkinson also has experience in dealing with otherworldly civilizations or culture, from Abydos to the Ohnes, and even to the Nox.

The alternate reality United States wasn't foreign at all. Gay marriage was approved, and there was a black president, but those changes can be seen miles away in nineteen ninety-eight. The conservatives might be aghast, but it was clear that the clock cannot be turned back.

Nonetheless, it was going to be a strange experience, and Parkinson has that in spades.

Despite being a diplomat from an alternate reality, Parkinson started to feel like a crackpot as a he approached a military installation.

A bored soldier jolted into alertness as the sight of a man in suit carrying a briefcase approached the security checkpoint.

This man wasn't in a car at all.

"I am Gerry Parkinson with the state department. I need to speak with the base commander as soon as possible."

"Can I see your identification please?" the soldier asked.

Parkinson obliged, giving him his nineteen ninety-eight documentations.

"Excuse me? Do you have anything more recent than this? Is this a joke?"

"No."

The soldier phoned the base headquarter. "Do we have a Gerry Parkinson meeting with the commander? No? OK."

Then the soldier turned his attention to the diplomat. "You don't have an appointment with the commander."

"Yes, um, this is an emergency. I am with the state department."

Twenty minutes on in an infuriating bureaucracy and a couple of google search, the soldier finally announced, "sir, you are under arrest for imitation of a government official."

Fucking finally.

Parkinson turned around for easy access to the handcuffs. "I can explain all of this, but it will be hard to believe," he said.

"Sure," the soldier said incredulously. "But Gerry Parkinson is stationed in China, having just talked to a Chinese official. Unless our diplomat can teleport."

Of course, this was how it was going to end. He hoped to get to the base commander and then to the POTUS of two thousand fifteen, but the security guard was too competent.

Parkinson had just deliberately put himself in a situations that he wouldn't want to be in. The interrogation room looked more like an office, rather than a place to question suspects.

The door opened up to a man and a woman. The smell of food waffled over the diplomat's nose.

"I am special agent Daniel Fox and this is special agent Madison Smith," the male FBI agent introduced myself before the both of them sat down opposite of the diplomat. "Would you like a hot dog as you answer our questions?"

"No."

"That's alright. How about we start with your name? Your real name."

"The only name I ever have in my life is Gerry Parkinson."

"The name of the diplomat you tried to impersonate earlier."

"I acknowledged that his name is Gerry Parkinson, but there's nothing against the law that say I cannot have the same name as him."

The FBI agent looked like he didn't believe that a single bit.
