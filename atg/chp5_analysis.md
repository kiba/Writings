**Hawthorne, Infopunk-Earth**

Captain Michael Griff of SG-2 wasn't one to refuse a milk-run job, even if he was just staring at a monitor connected to a camera, waiting for that green truck driver to deliver the packages, which were several boxes.

One of his teammate opened the door, talked a little bit and signed his name on the package. Before long, the driver drove away, unaware of his customers' true nature.

"Alright, let get the packages home," he said.

The boxes were unceremoniously moved on pallets by forklift, before arriving back in SGC.

The team then moved the packages into a meeting room before disassembling the boxes and accounting for every piece that was ordered by Cromwell.

"I want all stargate released merchandised packed up and ready to go," Griff said. "Make sure you don't damage the gadgets. Don't want our eggheads getting all uppity."

There were some quite chuckles at the joke.

Soon after, the engineers and the scientists were heralded in before being given equipment. Some were to be taken apart and examined, others to be used. Griff didn't care particularly, only that he was making sure that everything was accounted for by the end of the day.

Then they were done.

"Time to wheel the goodies to Virginia, boys," Griff said, referring to the state where the CIA headquarter was located.
