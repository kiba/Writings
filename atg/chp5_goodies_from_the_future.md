# Chapter Five: Goodies from the Future

**Doctor Bill Lee**
**SGC, SG-Earth**
**September 28, 2015**

Stargate Command never sleep. Likewise, the gate operates twenty-four hours around the clock. There was no way around a galaxy that doesn't necessary synchronize to the SGC's local timezone. However, research and development by and large operate separately of gate operations. Research and development wasn't as sensitive to events. There was still a sense of urgency at the command. To be sure, it was a race against the clock, even if they don't know when the clock will end. Still, there was no attempt by the upper brass to rush their research staff. It would be counter-productive, slowing the researchers down.

Doctor Bill Lee was just another scientist and engineer at SGC. He wasn't like Samantha Carter who went on dangerous missions. To him, working at the SGC was just like any other job. There were certain hours that he would work, and then he would go home at the end of the day.

To be sure, he loved his job. His boss and his boss' boss were efficient, facilitating the research staff's work rather than impeding it. There was a surprising lack of long unnecessary meeting. However, Monday, like everywhere else, proved to be a drag.

This Monday was an exception, as excitement were up in the air. Doctor Lee and other researchers were crowded out in a meeting room full of boxes, imagining the shiny gears that they will be receiving. Last week, Cromwell ordered parts and goods for the SGC, but delivery, like everything else, operated on 'business days'.

There were men behind those boxes, members from a SG team. Some of them hold clipboards, others were unpacking the boxes.

"Today this morning, I did a milk run," Captain Michael Griff, the leader of SG-2 said. "You know what I saw in two thousand fifteen? The same god damn green truck."

The room broke into scattered chuckles and laughs.

"That's right, ladies and gentlemen. The same green truck that I saw delivering items to this bunker, to my house, and my neighbor, was still delivering things in an alternate dimension almost two decade into the future in an alternate reality. But that's not what you guys are here for. Some things did changed, much of which you can't get anywhere on this Earth. Let's start handing out valuable research equipment."

There were healthy cheer for that.

Name and department was called. Individuals lined up. valuable handed out.

Unfortunately, fifty thousand dollars added up pretty quickly, and there were competing priorities, so not everyone get one. However, Doctor Bill Lee received a new mac computer that his department ordered. He was over the moon!

Once he took it back to his lab and tried to start using it, he realized one important thing: all the code and the software he had written were over in the positively ancient window machine. It's going to be a bitch to port over.

**Analyst Casey Martin**
**CIA headquarter, SG-Earth**
**September 30, 1998**

Analyst Casey Martin wasn't sure what to expect. He spent four years getting a bachelor degree in physics, expecting to work in the industry doing something useful, even if he doesn't know what that might be. Instead he landed a job in the CIA.

CIA was like any other job in many respect. There's orientation, the interview process, and a desk to work at. That is, until a sharply dressed man in his fifties showed up, yanked Martin from the first day of real work. From there, he was told that he will be working in the "Special Analytic Division" until further notice. That was not what he signed up for.

This man picked up three other equally bewildered analysts new to the CIA.

Together, they entered an anonymous looking door with a room number that didn't mean anything. On the table, there were promotional posters, books, and DVDs of a science fiction series, "Stargate SG-1". A futuristic looking television screen was set in the middle.

The director's gaze swept the analysts.

"I am Deputy Directory Burke Pigeon of the Special Analytic Division. From now on, you are my analysts. You are not permitted to speak of anything in this room to anyone outside of this room," the director said with absolute seriousness. "Whatever happened here is not a test, or a drill, or a prank. Do I make myself clear?"

"Yes, sir," the analysts found themselves chorusing.

"Good." The director then pointed to the pile of the material. "There are certain assumption and suspension of disbelief you have to make. Faster than light travel is possible. Time travel is possible. Otherwise, you will analyze the fictional material for any logical inconsistency, plot holes, mistakes in the story. You will build a database of characters, locations, planets, technologies, organizations, plot summary, and so forth. You analyze the fictional elements' connection with our reality, including any coincidence. You have my permission to bring in any non-classified open source materials that you see or find to the tune up to ten thousand dollars. I trust your group to use your money wisely. If we reach that limit, then we will discuss why you need more money. Is there any questions?"

"Sir, why are we analyzing fiction?" Martin asked.

"Good question! One that I, unfortunately, cannot answer for you. It will almost certainly bias your answer. That would be unacceptable. Nonetheless, as you go over the materials, I want you to think very hard about the question. When you are ready, I may or may not reveal why we are doing this."

"Are we allowed to contact anybody outside?" another analyst asked.

"No, you cannot. I mean it absolutely that you cannot speak of this to anyone, not even to ask questions. Whatever you learn in this room, stay in this room. Any more questions?"

None were forthcoming.

The director started handing everyone a folder. "In this folder are a list of questions we expect you to answer, but not the only questions you will answer. Don't expect that answering all those questions to mean that your work is over. I expect you to keep working, answering new questions that come up, until I tell you to stop. If you have any questions, I will try to answer. If I can't, you know the default answer I gave you earlier. I expect to have something at the end of the day."

Then he walked away before closing the door, leaving Casey Martin and the others on their own.

"What we do now?" Martin wondered.

Marty, James, and Fionia; that's the name of his teammates. It didn't matter what their expertise were, because it didn't take half a brain to uncover anomalies in the material. For instance, it was impossible not to notice the resolution and crispness of the television screen. From there, there were no known models on the market resembling the screen.

Case in point, by the end of the week, they were already making a presentation for the director, complete with a powerpoint presentation. As Casey Martin stood up to the podium. He sized up the director again.

The director didn't look the least bothered by any of those anomalies. He read every report that was handed in. Was this a test? No it couldn't be. Bruke made it clear that he wasn't try to trick them, but he was holding back secrets.

What kind of secrets lie behind Stargate SG-1? His team couldn't even begin to wonder.

"You handed us an assignment to analyze a body of fiction," Casey Martin started. "But it was not any ordinary body of work."

Bruke nodded as a confirmation.

Martin clicked to the next slide on the projector.

"Anomaly One: The Usage of Real People. Every single character is based on a real person. For example, Doctor Daniel Jackson is a crank academic, peddling alternate history about ancient aliens. He disappeared off the radar only to show up at a secretive government program. Curious. The actor behind him is correspondingly real, but he never work on this series. This is truth for most characters, even if the purported actors work in different industry."

There were no reaction from Bruke. None at all.

"Anomaly Two: The uncovering of black programs. What is Deep Space Telemetry? Why at NORAD? What is the purpose of the program. Why are so much bullets being spent at that one facility, or so many people dying in 'training accidents?' Yet it was deeply connected with the material."

Bruke looked like he was about to talk for several moments, but then motioned for the next slide.

"Anomaly Three: The use of advanced of technology. The model of the DVD player and the television screen clearly was far more advanced than what was possible today, yet clearly built on previous works. The models didn't appear in any catalogue anywhere in the world. Not in Japan or South Korea or China.

Our question now to you: what the hell are we involved in? Is this some sort of science fiction conspiracy?"

Bruke stood up. "I will now answer that question for you," he said. "There were some disagreement on how to handle disclosure of information. In the end it was decided that one of the analyst team will be kept in the dark as much as possible. This is to keep analysis of the materials unbiased as long as possible. Of course, that wasn't possible in the long term. Nonetheless, you compiled materials that were different from the other analyst team."

Bruke paused, before continuing again, "The Stargate is a real alien artifact, and that Deep Space Telemetry is actually a cover program for Project Blue Sky." Then he picked up a DVD. "But this? It's a complete work of fiction that happens to coincide with ours. Now, I am still not going to tell you which is which, that would bias you, but what I will tell you is those DVDs came from the future from an alternate reality."

"Shit" Martin echoed the thoughts of his teammate.

**Doctor Samantha Carter**
**October 3, 1998**

Doctor Bill Lee was next to Doctor Carter as they examined a program's innard on a computer several time more powerful than the supercomputer that runs the DHD.

Earth Swift's DHD was also homebrewed as well, and Swift was quick to inform that it may be an improved version of the same software that was used on the SGC's homebrewed DHD. He was right.

"Whoever made it did a very good forgery," Carter commented. "Or copied it from an alternate reality. We still don't know who did this, and how. But I can see traces of codes I written."

"Is it really ours?"

"I don't know."

The duo scrolled over to a comment. "ALL PROGRAMMERS: Do not allow any pull requests from Doctor Rodney Mckay without my permission or approval. -- Doctor Samantha Carter."

"Who's Rodney McKay?"

Carter shrugged. "I haven't heard of this person, but it doesn't sound good either."

Finally, they ended up on the really juicy part of the codebase.

"I think this region of code's about gate address generation."

"Huh. The history pretty deep and extensive. There's a lot of changes and improvements made. Think we can use it?"

"I don't understand a whole lot of it, but it seemed to be pulling from several dozen of different astronomical sources, both from telescopes and from gate travel. But I don't see why we can't port some of the useful code over."

***
**October 9, 1998**

It took a whole week for Carter and the physic team to understand some of the code, and then improve only some of them into the now obsolete DHD supercomputer, which was slated to be replaced by hardwares from Earth Swift some time in the near future.

"We're ready," Harriman announced.

"Good, run the program," Carter ordered.

The program ran through an address generation algorithm, pinging the stargate subspace network. Viable addresses came in, eliciting excitement from the astrophysics team.

There were new viable addresses located across the galaxy. Of especially importance was addresses outside of Goa'uld space, and addresses close to home.

"We did it!" Lee squee in excitement.

"Yes. We can thank Earth Swift for that," Carter concurred. "Of course, the hard part is yet to come. We will need to take risk and explore those addresses."

With the amount of addresses they had before, it was already going to take a lifetime. Now it might take potential generations with the current budget of the stargate program.

"We're going to implement those safety code as soon as possible, right?" Bill Lee asked.

"We'll need to, given that we're ignoring signals because we don't know know. Now we know."

The code for gate safety was being reviewed, but it took longer because it cannot be tested as easily as the address generation algorithm.
