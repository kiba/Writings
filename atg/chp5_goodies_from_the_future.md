# Chapter Five: Goodies from the Future

**Doctor Bill Lee**
**SGC, SG-Earth**

Stargate Command never sleep. The gate operated at all hours of the day, traffic constantly coming in and out. However, research and development by and large operate separately of gate operations, and viewed as a long term thing, not going to yield immediate result.

Doctor Bill Lee, like other scientists and engineers, work regular weekdays at just like any other jobs. Except in emergency, in which case said scientists and engineers were paid hefty sum to work around the clock.

He loved his job, but Monday like everywhere else, was a drag. This Monday proved to be an exception, as excitement were up in the air. Doctor Lee and other researchers were crowded out in a meeting room full of boxes. Last week, Cromwell ordered parts and goods for the SGC, but delivery, like everything else, operated on 'business days'.

That's what the boxes are for.

There were men behind those boxes, members from the SGC, holding clipboards, and unpacking.

"Today this morning, I did a milk run," Captain Michael Griff, the leader of SG-2 said. "You know what I saw in two thousand fifteen? The same god damn green truck."

The room broke into scattered chuckles and laughs.

"That's right, ladies and gentlemen. The same green truck that I saw deliver stuff, was still delivering things in an alternate dimension almost two decade into the future. But that's not what you guys are here for. Some things had changed, much of which you can't get right now. Without further ado, let start the procurement handout process."

There were healthy cheer for that.

Name and department were called, the SG team handling out new hardwares, mostly computers, but also scientific instruments.

Fifty thousand dollars added up pretty quickly, so the process wasn't overly long. Soon, Doctor Bill Lee received a new mac computer that his department ordered. He was over the moon!

However, once he took it back to his lab and tried to start using it, he realized one important thing: all the code and the software he had written were over in the positively ancient window machine. It's going to be a bitch to port over.

**Analyst Casey Martin**
**CIA headquarter, SG-Earth**
**September 30, 1998**

Analyst Casey Martin wasn't sure what to expect. He spent four years getting a bachelor degree in physics, expecting to work in the industry doing something. Instead he landed a job in the CIA.

CIA was like any other job in many respect. There's orientation, the interview process, and offices to work with. That is, until a sharply dressed man in his fifties showed up, yanked Martin from the first day of real work. From there, he was told that he will be working in the "Special Analytic Division" until further notice. That was not what he signed up for.

This man picked up three other equally bewildered analysts new to the CIA.

Together, they entered an anonymous looking door with a room number that didn't mean anything. On the table, there were promotional posters, books, and DVDs of a science fiction series, "Stargate". A futuristic looking television screen was set in the middle.

The director's gaze swept the analysts.

"I am Deputy Directory Burke Pigeon of the Special Analytic Division. From now on, you are my analysts. You are not permitted to speak of anything in this room to anyone outside of this room," the director said with absolute seriousness. "Whatever happened here is not a test, or a drill, or a prank. Do I make myself clear?"

"Yes, sir," the analysts found themselves chorusing.

"Good." The director then pointed to the pile of the material. "There are certain assumption and suspension of disbelief you have to make. Faster than light travel is possible. Time travel is possible. Otherwise, you will analyze the fictional material for any logical inconsistency, plot holes, mistakes in the story. You will build a database of characters, locations, planets, technologies, organizations, plot summary, and so forth. You analyze the fictional elements' connection with our reality, including any coincidence. You have my permission to bring in any non-classified open source materials that you see or find to the tune up to ten thousand dollars. I trust your group to use your money wisely. Then we will discuss why you need more money. Is there any questions?"

"Sir, why are we analyzing fiction?" Martin asked.

"Good question! One that I unfortunately, cannot answer for you. It will almost certainly bias you. Nonetheless, as you go over the materials, I want you to think very hard about the question. When you are ready, I may or may not reveal why we are doing this."

"Are we allowed to contact anybody outside.?" another analyst asked.

"No, you cannot. I mean it absolutely that you cannot speak of this to anyone, not even to ask questions. Whatever go in this room, stay in this room. Any more questions?"

None were forthcoming.

The director started handing everyone a folder. "In this folder are a list of questions we expect you to answer, but not the only questions you will answer. Don't expect that answering these questions to mean that your work is over. I expect you to keep working until I say that you are done. If you have any questions, I will try to answer. If I can't, you know the default answer I gave you earlier. I expect to have something at the end of the day."

Then he walked away before closing the door, leaving Casey Martin and the others on their own.

"What we do now?" Martin wondered.
