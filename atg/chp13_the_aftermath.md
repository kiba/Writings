# Chapter Thirteen: The Aftermath

***
**Major General George Hammond**
**SGC, SG-Earth**
**December 4, 1998**

The general slumped into the chair. A very piece of grim news came in. Sokar had just slaughtered his enemies in a lop-sided battle. There was nothing holding back the system lord and his forces. He was free to trample his adversaries across the galaxy.

"You could ask the Asgard for their protection," Selmak suggested.

"Then they will take our gate away and forbid us from develop weapons for self-defense," Hammond said. "When the Asgard die out, what will we do, then?"

"It may be Earth's only option for survival," Carter pointed out.

"The president will go absolutely ballistic about this, but he'll understand. How much time do we have?"

"We don't know," Selmak said. "It depends on his campaign and how stubborn and adaptive the Goa'uld are."

"The lack of innovation shown by the Goa'uld is what we count on in order to buy time. Now we want them to do the opposite. Ironic."

"We cannot give up, no matter what we do."

The general stood up from his chair. "Excuse me, I'll have to call the president. "

**Doctor Daniel Jackson**
**Alpha Site**

It was a somewhat depressing day. SG-1 was recruited into moving equipment and helping out Alpha Site. It wasn't in the job description, but that was not what upset them. This was necessary; urgent.

By now, the grim news had spread. Vast swath of Goa'uld territories are being conquered light years away. The enemy cannot be simply defeated with a well placed nuclear bomb.

Doctor Daniel Jackson and Colonel Jack O'Neill were shelving books together in Jackson's new room slash home, organized by a schema. The doctor finally felt that his system was in fact not working at all, though O'Neill didn't comment on his organization.

"We can't fight against Sokar," O'Neill complained as he put a book away. "We got no spaceships, and such capable warships was years away. The Asgards are willing to help us, but that would mean accepting the protection planet treaty and hiding our shipbuilding program covertly."

"I thought you were going to comment on the book organization," Jackson said.

O'Neill snorted. "It's about time."

"We could do what we did in the show. Uncover a Goa'uld plot, get us brownie points, and continue to explore the stars as usual."

"If there will be backstabbing involved, and if any of the system lords stay alive long enough, if anything from the show actually translates. We already found out that the source material can be both totally wrong and on the spot."

"What is our plan? What can we do?"

"I don't know. Buy time, somehow. I sure hope the Tok'ra are doing that. I shouldn't have killed Ra. He would keep it together until Sokar got arrogant enough to invade."

"But then Sakraa and Sha'uri wouldn't be free."

"They are taken," O'Neill said. "Made hosts by those damn snakehead."

The two men didn't speak further. They organized Jackson' apartment before leaving for another job.

This will be their permanent home.

**Major General George Hammond**

The general rushed to the first plane to Washington as soon as he can. It wasn't quite an emergency, but the galactic events that had transpired demanded a meeting with the president in-person to discuss and lay out plans for the future.

There was a strong possibility that this Earth would be threatened in the near future and that the protected planet treaty might not be enough.

After Hammond left the plane, he headed straight for the whitehouse and then to the president's conference table. The presidents' advisers were already seated.

"You just arrived in time," the president said. "Have a seat." There was a faint outline of a slap to the face. Hammond dismissed his foreknowledge as unimportant.

"We just received a very important news from Project Blue Sky. General Hammond is in charge of that project."

"The Goa'uld empire had plunged into a full scaled war," Hammond said. "Keep in mind that while they are our enemies, they also have powerful combat platforms that can roam between stars. We can't, and there is no way that we could progress any faster. As such, we might get caught in the middle of it. Our ally Tok'ra is working with us to redirect movement away from our home, but that is not guaranteed."
