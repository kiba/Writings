# Chapter Thirteen: The Aftermath

The general slumped into the chair. A very piece of grim news came in. Sokar had just slaughtered his enemies in a lop-sided battle. There was nothing holding back the system lord and his forces. He was free to trample his adversaries across the galaxy.

"You could ask the Asgard for their protection," Selmak suggested.

"Then they will take our gate away and forbid us from develop weapons for self-defense," Hammond said. "When the Asgard die out, what will we do, then?"

"It may be Earth's only option for survival," Carter pointed out.

"The president will go absolutely ballistic about this, but he'll understand. How much time do we have?"

"We don't know," Selmak said. "It depends on his campaign and how stubborn and adaptive the Goa'uld are."

"The lack of innovation shown by the Goa'uld is what we count on in order to buy time. Now we want them to do the opposite. Ironic."

"We cannot give up, no matter what we do."

It was a somewhat depressing day. SG-1 was recruited into moving equipment and helping out Alpha Site. It wasn't in the job description, but that was not what upset them. This was necessary; urgent.

By now, the grim news had spread. Vast swath of Goa'uld territories are being conquered light years away. The enemy cannot be simply defeated with a well placed nuclear bomb.
