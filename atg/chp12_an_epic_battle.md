# Chapter Twelves: An Epic Battle

A lone cloaked Al'kesh watched over Sokar's star system. An event he expected and hoped to happen failed to pass.

The primitive naquadah bomb failed to make it through the gate. Sokar lived. His ally's plan was good, but that was dependent on Sokar acting like any other interchangable Goa'uld. Martouf/Lantash could guess that the gate was protected properly with a shield.

It was the last ditch attempt to stop or weakened Sokar before the battle.

Martouf watched as a fleet dropped out of hyperspace and began approaching the Sokar homeworld. His heart dropped into his stomach. It didn't look good at all. The Goa'uld alliance was already outnumbered two to one. Either some of the system lords dropped out of the battle, or that other Goa'uld motherships were too far away.

At first, the battle seemed to have gone well for the Goa'uld combined fleet. Three ha'tak belonging to Sokar was destroyed in the first few minutes.

Then Sokar disgorged more death gliders than he ever seen before, firing quad cannons, yet moving only slightly slower than ever before.

There must be a lot of farms down there to feed such a large jaffa population.
