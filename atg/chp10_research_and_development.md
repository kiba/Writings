# Chapter Ten: Research and Development

***
**Doctor Bill Lee**
**Area Fifty-Two, SG-Earth**
**October 27, 1998**

One of the perk of being a researcher at the most top secret military program in the world is that one is afforded leeway and privileges in order to do a job, like being able to piggyback on a military plane to fly to other top secret locations. Services on such plane was predictably bad, but in some ways it beats waiting in line and getting stuffed like sardine into a plane.

That was how Bill Lee arrived in the legendary Area 52, where supposedly Roswell aliens has landed. It was probably rouge Asgards. Lee heard that SGC had gotten their hands on the destroyed craft, though he didn't know the status of that particular research project, since it didn't really pertain to the projects that he was working on.

He stumbled out of the aircraft along with top secret cargo onto the desert landing strip. Predictably, it was scorchingly hot. He hurried to the air conditioned reception center.

After checking in, and walking to another building, he finally arrived at the testing range.

One of the first alien objects that the SGC captured was from Apophis's Jaffa. Since then, the SGC captured as many of the Goa'uld weapon systems as they could get on hand. It was very easy to do so since the Jaffa frequently died in dove at a tactically superior and better led enemy.

A staff weapon was a terrible design in more way than one, more of a tool used to terrorize slaves than to fight actual ground battles. The trigger assembly was easy to press, given the lack of a guard, making unintended fire easy to do.. There's no way you can held the staff weapon against your shoulder plate, unless you have long enough arm, which affect the staff's accuracy by letting the recoil shook the weapon.

Nonetheless, it was studied and taken apart by researchers to see how it work, as it was an example of actual energy weapon. Tok'ra technical experts occasionally gave lecture on how the device works.

It had been months since Doctor Lee was at area fifty-one. Last time, he set up a rig for testing rig for testing how long a staff weapon might last.

Now, he was at the range again, still hearing the tell-tale sign of the staff weapon firing.

"How long it was firing?" he asked one of the range officer.

"Since you left."

"Wow!"

"It's a very reliable weapon platform. Ashamed that it has such horror firing rate."

Lee could see the scorches that was made into the side of a hill. It hadn't penetrated at all, but the side of the hill was blasted repeatedly into glasses.

"Awesome!" Lee exclaimed.

The staff weapon project was an idea of low priority, especially SGC had since discovered juicier alien technology to reverse engineer, but he was still a fan of the staff weapon, and was able to convince his department to let him work on it in his spare time.

Lee clapped his hands and rubbed it. "Exceelllllent!" he said. "I got a couple of prototype that I wanted to try."

The range officer raised his eyebrows.

"I got the Sapphire Four Thousand, a rotary energy weapon. Heavy duty. Then there's the plasma rocket engine that I built."

"I am very skeptical."

"Why would you be?"

"Because it got cheesy names."

"They are not cheesy. They're cool names, and they work."

"Whatever you said. I don't want anything to blow up."

After an hour of rigging the heavy weapon platform. The range office and Doctor Lee hid in a nearby bunker together.

"Three...two..one, fire in the hole!" the officer announced, pulling the trigger.

There was a rapid fire of plasma ball spitted by the prototype, its scorch marks hitting widely off targets.

Then it stopped.

"Oh," Lee said, embarrassed. He thought he fixed it.

Lee crossed his finger as the officer pulled the trigger. Stream of plasma rushed from the reaction engine.

It worked! The doctor smiled at his success, doing a victory dance. Later, he found out that the plasma engine was much worse than the ion drive in specific impulse, but greater amount of thrust. Essentially, he created an engine that was in-between the rocket engines and ion engines.

**Doctor Samantha Carter**
**November 3, 1998**
**Alpha Site**

Earth itself was was smack in the middle of Goa'uld, which was a very precarious position to be in. However, Sol has long since ran out of naquadah, so there was little reason for the Goa'uld to come to Earth, but it was understood that may not be the case forever, especially if Earth started building hyperdrive capable starships.

The Alpha Site was chosen for its distance, and the lack of naquadah on planet or in space, reducing any interests from aliens. It was very similar to Earth in many way, and geologic survey suggested that it was terraformed hundred of thousand years ago, seeded with Earth lifeforms.

Stargate Command chosen to considerably expand the facility built there since the beginning of the year, and future Earth started helping out as well.

It was also a test facility for a very important project.

Doctor Samantha Carter and her commanding officer walked away from the stargate, the pool disappearing.

"Are there magnets involved?" O'Neill joked.

"Yes, sir. We're using magnets," Carter answered it straight.

"You know, I expect either a very complicated answer, or a joke answer."

"Electromagnetism is a force we work with everyday. It would be very strange if it didn't involve magnets."

"So, about the hyperspace drive; that will give us the ability to touch our enemies, right?"

"It's only a very small component. The test will generate a hyperspace window to enter. We will need to use some sort of thrusters to move inside of it."

"I thought the hyperspace drive is responsible for moving inside hyperspace?"

"Not at all. All the drive can do is dive into a certain layer of subspace. The deeper you go, the faster you can go using the same thrusters, but the harder it is to maintain a hyperspace window."

The duo met up with the engineers for the project, and they walked to a hangar where an Alkesh was located.

The Al'kesh was the workhorse of the Goa'uld empire, and it can be found pretty much anywhere there's Goa'uld. It served a wide variety of roles, everything from bombing, to scouting, and cargo delivery. It was also much more plentiful and often less secured than a typical Ha'tak mothership, and just as reliable and long lasting.

Thus, it was an ideal vehicle to steal. Thankfully, the SGC did not have to raid a Goa'uld base to get one. The Tok'ra gifted the SGC not just one, but three for the SGC to study and reverse engineer.

The SGC since then used one Al'kesh for transport such as this one, the other two dissected.

When she wasn't doing missions with SG-1, her primary project was focused on the hyperdrive engine, the critical component enabling intergalactic travel. Even if Earth reverse engineered everything else and began production, they would be unable to strike against their enemies, the ships stranded in the solar system. A good defense is a good offense.

Building on the understanding of Goa'uld hyperdrive, she and her team built a much simpler hyperdrive window generator. It was even housed in a shipping container, strapped to an Al'kesh naquadah generator, which Earth did not know how to make, even though they understood the theories.

The Al'kesh life off, the shipping container that housed the drive, going with them. She saw the spacecraft disappearing from the planet altogether.

If the Tok'ra was uncooperative like they were in the television series, it would take the SGC years to get anywhere. Thankfully, the alliance in this reality was much more expansive.

The only information she's receiving right now was relayed by satellites orbiting the planet, having been launched by the same Al'kesh.

Then there was momentarily no information. The Al'kesh made a planned hyperspace jump one AU(astronomical unit) from here, judged sufficiently safe. From there, it should detached the shipping container, and jumped half of an AU here. From there, the Al'kesh witnessed the prototype generated a hyperspace window for only a brief second.

It was anticlimactic.
