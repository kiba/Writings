# Chapter Ten: Research and Development

**Doctor Bill Lee**
**Area Fifty-Two, SG-Earth**
**October 27, 1998**

One of the perk of being a researcher at the most top secret military program in the world is that one is afforded leeway and privileges in order to do a job, like being able to piggyback on a military plane to fly to other top secret locations. Services on such plane was predictably bad, but in some ways it beats waiting in line and getting stuffed like sardine into a plane.

That was how Bill Lee arrived in the legendary Area 52, where supposedly Roswell aliens has landed. It was probably rouge Asgards. Lee heard that SGC had gotten their hands on the destroyed craft, though he didn't know the status of that particular research project, since it didn't really pertain to the projects that he was working on.

He stumbled out of the aircraft along with top secret cargo onto the desert landing strip. Predictably, it was scorchingly hot. He hurried to the air conditioned reception center.

After checking in, and walking to another building, he finally arrived at the testing range.

One of the first alien objects that the SGC captured was from Apophis's Jaffa. Since then, the SGC captured as many of the Goa'uld weapon systems as they could get on hand. It was very easy to do so since the Jaffa frequently died in dove at a tactically superior and better led enemy.

A staff weapon was a terrible design in more way than one, more of a tool used to terrorize slaves than to fight actual ground battles. The trigger assembly was easy to press, given the lack of a guard, making unintended fire easy to do.. There's no way you can held the staff weapon against your shoulder plate, unless you have long enough arm, which affect the staff's accuracy by letting the recoil shook the weapon.

Nonetheless, it was studied and taken apart by researchers to see how it work, as it was an example of actual energy weapon. Tok'ra technical experts occasionally gave lecture on how the device works.

It had been months since Doctor Lee was at area fifty-one. Last time, he set up a rig for testing rig for testing how long a staff weapon might last.

Now, he was at the range again, still hearing the tell-tale sign of the staff weapon firing.

"How long it was firing?" he asked one of the range officer.

"Since you left."

"Wow!"

"It's a very reliable weapon platform. Ashamed that it has such horror firing rate."

Lee could see the scorches that was made into the side of a hill. It hadn't penetrated at all, but the side of the hill was blasted repeatedly into glasses.

"Awesome!" Lee exclaimed.

The staff weapon project was an idea of low priority, especially SGC had since discovered juicier alien technology to reverse engineer, but he was still a fan of the staff weapon, and was able to convince his department to let him work on it in his spare time.

Lee clapped his hands and rubbed it. "Exceelllllent!" he said. "I got a couple of prototype that I wanted to try."

The range officer raised his eyebrows.

"I got the Sapphire Four Thousand, a rotary energy weapon. Heavy duty. Then there's the plasma rocket engine that I built."

"I am very skeptical."

"Why would you be?"

"Because it got cheesy names."

"They are not cheesy. They're cool names, and they work."

"Whatever you said. I don't want anything to blow up."

After an hour of rigging the heavy weapon platform. The range office and Doctor Lee hid in a nearby bunker together.

"Three...two..one, fire in the hole!" the officer announced, pulling the trigger.

There was a rapid fire of plasma ball spitted by the prototype, its scorch marks hitting widely off targets.

Then it stopped.

"Oh," Lee said, embarrassed. He thought he fixed it.

***

Lee crossed his finger as the officer pulled the trigger. Stream of plasma rushed from the reaction engine.

It worked! The doctor smiled at his success, doing a victory dance. Later, he found out that the plasma engine was much worse than the ion drive in specific impulse, but greater amount of thrust. Essentially, he created an engine that was in-between the rocket engines and ion engines.

**Doctor Samantha Carter**
**November 3, 1998**
**Alpha Site**

Earth itself was was smack in the middle of Goa'uld, which was a very precarious position to be in. However, Sol has long since ran out of naquadah, so there was little reason for the Goa'uld to come to Earth, but it was understood that may not be the case forever, especially if Earth started building hyperdrive capable starships.

The Alpha Site was chosen for its distance, and the lack of naquadah on planet or in space, reducing any interests from aliens. It was very similar to Earth in many way, and geologic survey suggested that it was terraformed hundred of thousand years ago, seeded with Earth lifeforms.

Stargate Command chosen to considerably expand the facility built there since the beginning of the year, and future Earth started helping out as well.

It was also a test facility for a very important project.

Doctor Samantha Carter and her commanding officer walked away from the stargate, the pool disappearing.

"Are there magnets involved?" O'Neill joked.

"Yes, sir. We're using magnets," Carter answered it straight.

"You know, I expect either a very complicated answer, or a joke answer."

"Electromagnetism is a force we work with everyday. It would be very strange if it didn't involve magnets."

"So, about the hyperspace drive; that will give us the ability to touch our enemies, right?"

"It's only a very small component. The test will generate a hyperspace window to enter. We will need to use some sort of thrusters to move inside of it."

"I thought the hyperspace drive is responsible for moving inside hyperspace?"

"Not at all. All the drive can do is dive into a certain layer of subspace. The deeper you go, the faster you can go using the same thrusters, but the harder it is to maintain a hyperspace window."

The duo met up with the engineers for the project, and they walked to a hangar where an Alkesh was located.

The Al'kesh was the workhorse of the Goa'uld empire, and it can be found pretty much anywhere there's Goa'uld. It served a wide variety of roles, everything from bombing, to scouting, and cargo delivery. It was also much more plentiful and often less secured than a typical Ha'tak mothership, and just as reliable and long lasting. That made it an ideal vehicle to steal.

Thankfully, the SGC did not have to raid a Goa'uld outpost to steal one. The Tok'ra gifted the SGC not just one, but three for the SGC to study and reverse engineer. If the Tok'ra was uncooperative like they were in the television series, it would take the SGC years to get anywhere. Thankfully, the alliance in this reality was much more expansive.

The SGC since then used one Al'kesh for transport such as this one, though they had to take it apart before putting it back together. That was an educational experience.

"How many projects you were working on again?" O'Neill asked.

"When we aren't on a mission, half to all of my day is spent on this," Carter replied. "Though recently, I focused exclusively on the hyperdrive."

"Nobody gets as much as done as you, and you still go on missions with us. Nobody."

"I am flattered sir, but the hyperspace project was a collaborative project, driven mostly by fellow physicists rather than me. You also forgot Daniel Jackson."

"How so?"

"He wore just as many hats as me."

O'Neill nodded.

Normally, O'Neill did not bother to listen to scientific or engineering explanation, but the Colonel has a keen interest in building and flying warships, since he was a former pilot. He was no stranger to technical details. The special force operator listened and asked questions while Carter explained what she was trying to do with the hyperdrive.

Building on their understanding of Goa'uld hyperdrive, she and her team built the simplest hyperdrive window generator they knew but still could work. It was housed in a shipping container, with the energy supplied by a Al'kesh naquadah generator, and a heatsink. Everything that was unnecessary to the operation of the hyperdrive was jettisoned, leaving only the necessary details for the team to focus on.

"They're moving it out now," Carter said as the hangar door opened.

Once in the open field of the airbase, the Al'kesh lift off, with the hyperdrive slung beneath it. Everyone on the ground watched as it accelerated through the atmosphere, effortlessly reaching escaping velocity before disappearing from the naked eyes.

"Let's go inside," she said, leading the colonel into the command center. From that place, everyone could see the telemetry relayed by a network of satellites, having been inserted around the extrasolar system by the same Al'kesh carrying the hyperdrive.

"Executing hyperspace jump," the pilot announced with measured tone.

Momentarily, there was no information coming from the telemetry once the Al'kesh disappeared into hyperspace, jumping only a light-minute.

"I have safely arrived. Running through one last diagnostic test before releasing the clamp." A minute later, the Al'kesh released the shipping container, before jumping forward a good distance away.

A satellite was nearby, ready to record the hyperdrive activating from an external viewpoint, as well relay back information from the hyperdrive.

"Testing, in 3...2...1...activating," the mission director announced.

The device generated a telltale hyperspace window for a split second, before disappearing.

It was anticlimactic, but the mission control room erupted in cheer regardless.

"That's it?" O'Neill said with disbelief. "Just one second of a tiny hyperspace window that even the shipping container can't even fit through."

"It gave physicists something solid to work with," Carter said. "The hyperdrive is not something we'll be able to master in one prototype. Like every overwhelming problem I ever struggled with, we divide them into its constituent parts to make it tractable to us. We want to understand the basic so that we can proceed confidently to the next level."

"We can't just copy it?"

"The Tok'ra are spies, and they do not have the infrastructures to build a ship from scratch. All their Al'kesh are either stolen or brought on the market, before modified to their needs."

Before long, the Al'kesh retrieved the hyperdrive before returning back to the Alpha Site.

**Doctor Bill Lee**
**November 8, 1998**
**SGC, SG-Earth**

After the somewhat embarrassing test in area fifty-two. Lee went back to the drawing board and fixed the design. He went to the Alpha Site back and forth several time once they expanded their facility to include a test range. Since then He only went back to area fifty-two to talk with the researchers there. Several iterations later, Bill Lee felt satisfied that it was ready for firing by sentient beings, rather than blowing up their users.

The Sapphire Four Thousand Mark One was heavy to haul around, so Doctor Lee put his baby on a rolling cart, pushing it until he reached Teal'c's residence, the Jaffa never bothering with the complication of finding an apartment in Colorado Spring.

Lee knocked the door.

"Who is it?"

"This is Doctor Lee. Remembered the weapon that I am working on? It's ready to test."

The door opened, revealing Teal'c's neutral face. Lee thought he would be more excited, but he guessed wrong.

"I am ready," Teal'c stated laconically.

"Ah, I already set up an appointment to visit the Alpha Site. We should absolutely have no problem!" Nobody can go in and out of the stargate to anywhere without the express mission of General Hammond, and only when it didn't conflict with anyone's schedule. If someone's using the gate, another can't.

**Alpha Site**

Once at the test range, Lee attempted to launch into an exposition, "The Sapphire Four Thousand is a-"

"How do I fire?" Teal'c asked, not touching the weapon. Lee felt slightly disappointed at not being able to regal the Jaffa with specs. "I want to do it safely."

Lee showed the Jaffa how to handle the weapon.

There were already test targets of varying difficulty set up by the range.

Teal'c fired when ready, destroying first a dummy, then a jeep, and finally a very old tank.

The Sapphire Four Thousand destroyed them with contemptible ease, with munitions that was essentially unlimited.

Teal'c put down the gun. Then he gave out a laughter that sent a chill down Lee's spine. If there was any great villain laughter, it would be Teal'c's voice.

"When can I use this weapon?" Teal'c asked, with a very eager face.

"Ummm.....it's a very long process, but I am sure that I can get it expedited," Lee said.
