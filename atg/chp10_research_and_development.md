# Chapter Ten: Research and Development

**Area Fifty-Two, SG-Earth**
**October 27, 1998**

One of the perk of being a researcher at the most top secret military program in the world is that one is afforded leeway and privileges in order to do a job, like being able to piggyback on a military plane to fly to other top secret locations. Services on such plane was predictably bad, but in some ways it beats waiting in line and getting stuffed like sardine into a plane.

That was how Bill Lee arrived in the legendary Area 52, where supposedly Roswell aliens has landed. It was probably the Asgard, maybe even Loki. Lee heard that SGC had gotten their hands on the destroyed craft, thought he didn't know the status of that particular research project, given that secret projects were usually on only a need-to-know basis.

He stumbled out of the aircraft along with top secret cargo onto the desert landing strip. Predictably, it was scorchingly hot. He hurried to the air conditioned reception center.

After checking in, and walking to another building, he finally arrived at the testing range.

One of the first alien objects that the SGC captured was from Apophis's Jaffa. Since then, the SGC captured as many of the Goa'uld weapon systems as they could get on hand. It was very easy to do so since the Jaffa frequently died in dove at a tactically superior and better led enemy.

A staff weapon was a terrible design in more way than one, more of a tool used to terrorize slaves than to fight actual ground battles. The trigger assembly was easy to press, given the lack of a guard, making unintended fire easy to do.. There's no way you can held the staff weapon against your shoulder plate, unless you have long enough arm, which affect the staff's accuracy by letting the recoil shook the weapon.

Nonetheless, it was studied and taken apart by researchers to see how it work, as it was an example of actual energy weapon. Tok'ra technical experts occasionally gave lecture on how the device works.

It had been months since Doctor Lee was at area fifty-one. Last time, he set up a rig for testing rig for testing how long a staff weapon might last.

Now, he was at the range again, still hearing the tell-tale sign of the staff weapon firing.

"How long it was firing?" he asked one of the range officer.

"Since you left."

"Wow!"

"It's a very reliable weapon platform. Ashamed that it has such horror firing rate."

Lee could see the scorches that was made into the side of a hill. It hadn't penetrated at all, but the side of the hill was blasted repeatedly into glasses.

"Awesome!" Lee exclaimed.

The staff weapon project was an idea of low priority, especially SGC had since discovered juicier alien technology to reverse engineer, but he was still a fan of the staff weapon, and was able to convince his department to let him work on it in his spare time.

Lee clapped his hands and rubbed it. "Exceelllllent!" he said. "I got a couple of prototype that I wanted to try."

The range officer raised his eyebrows.

"I got the Sapphire Four Thousand, a rotary energy weapon. Heavy duty. Then there's the plasma rocket engine that I built."

"I am very skeptical."

"Why would you be?"

"Because it got cheesy names."

"They are not cheesy. They're cool names, and they work."

"Whatever you said. I don't want anything to blow up."

After an hour of rigging the heavy weapon platform. The range office and Doctor Lee hid in a nearby bunker together.

"Three...two..one, fire in the hole!" the officer announced, pulling the trigger.

There was a rapid fire of plasma ball spitted by the prototype, its scorch marks hitting widely off targets.

Then it stopped.

"Oh," Lee said, embarrassed. He thought he fixed it.

Lee crossed his finger as the officer pulled the trigger. Stream of plasma rushed from the reaction engine.

It worked! The doctor smiled at his success, doing a victory dance. Later, he found out that the plasma engine was much worse than the ion drive in specific impulse, but greater amount of thrust. Essentially, he created an engine that was in-between the rocket engines and ion engines.
