Chp1: Stranger Things

When Colonel Frank Cromwell first joined the Stargate program, he at first thought it was an extremely elaborate joke, or an exercise in lateral thinking. It turned out that the Stargate program did involve a whole lot of lateral thinking, and not only that. The Stargate was an absolutely real piece of machinery.

He saw the technological marvel up close and personal, even as he exchanged barbs and arguments with Colonel O'Neill. That man was never happy to see him.

Aside from his estranged relations with a fellow serviceman, his team and himself studied the layout until they know it like the back of their own backyard. Next, they studied the various encounters that the various exploration teams encountered to date, such as the seven foot tall Jaffa slave soldiers and their hijacking snake masters to sapient crystals and a subset of an advanced human civilization. In short, in the place that was Stargate Command, anything could happen.

And here he was. Something did happened to him. He got sucked into a blackhole, and he was supposed to be dead. Instead, he realized that he was on some sort of movie set.

The two men in front of him groaned as they got themselves up. He had no idea if they hostile or friendly. In truth, he didn't know what to do in such a situation.

What languages do they speak? What is a stargate doing here on a set? Maybe this is time travel? Whatever the case may be, he didn't have a whole lot of time to ponder. Weirdly, they didn't look too alien to him either, even though everything felt slightly off.

"I come in peace?" Cromwell said hesitantly.

"Oh, look, it's Colonel Frank Cromwell!" the thin man said, though still looking dazed.

"Frank who?" the fat man asked.

"The guy who got sucked in by a black hole saving Stargate Command," the other responded automatically.

"Oohhhh."

Cromwell raised his eyebrows in confusion. It was as if they were talking about the past. Maybe they're filming a documentary. If so, why are they allowed access to an actual stargate?

"Excuse me? What year is it?"

"Two thousand fifteen."

Shit. He had been thrown seventeen years into the future!

"Wait a minute? Did you hire the original actor to play Frank Cromwell?" the fatman asked another question.

"I did not- Oh!" the thin man realized. "Did we just got knocked out by something flying at us after a whirlpool unexpectedly splashed out from the stargate?"

"Hmm...now that I think about it. Yes."

"And where does this man came from? I did not invite him to the set."

The duo glared at Cromwell more intently. "Who the hell are you?" the fat man finally asked.

Cromwell blinked, uncomprehending of the situation he found himself in. 2015. 1998. Time travel? That has got to be it. But what about the Stargate? Who are those two men? What are they doing with a highly classified machine? His mind raced about trying to see what he should do next.

Finally after an impasse of about a minute, Cromwell finally answered. "I am Colonel Frank Cromwell of the United States Air Force. I believe I just travel seventeen years into the future via the stargate. Now please tell me how the hell you acquired this device behind my back?"

The fat man turned to the thin man. "I thought you told me that this stargate is just a prop!"

"I swear! I thought it was just a prop too! Look, there's no fucking way that a stargate can possibly be real anyway! It's fucking fiction! You of all people should know that faster than light travel violate the laws of physics. Frank Cromwell is fiction! FICTION! None of all that should be possible!"

"Wait? I am fiction?" Cromwell asked as he stepped closer.

"If he isn't a trespasser," the fat man reasoned. "Then he's Frank Cromwell. In the flesh."

"And so what if I am? I have  half a mind to restrain the both of you and call for my superior for possession of properties that belonged only to the federal government."

The thin man putted his hand up, gesturing for Cromwell to stop. "Look man, what if you show us irrefutable truth that you're fiction!"

"By showing me a movie?"

"No, but I have all ten seasons of Stargate SG-1 on my laptop."

"What? How is that possible?"

"Moore's law! I mean Kryder's law. Whatever the law may be, you should accept that I can do this in two thousand fifteen. What year you came from? I don't have the exact timeline in my head."

"October nineteen ninety-eight," Cromwell answered. "What is your name?"

"This is John Swift, a Silicon Valley billionaire, and I am Vincent Sinclair, just a humble science fiction author," the fat man introduced the duo.

"I am going to get my laptop," Swift said.

"No. I am following you, and your associate will come with you. I am keeping my eyes on both of you," Cromwell demanded.

A moment passed as Swift thought about the demand. "Yes, I see no problem with that," Swift affirmed.

With that the trio made their trek across the pristine flooring toward the exit of the massive warehouse. When they finally arrived outside the Berkovitz electric car, Swift took out his car fob, allowing the door handle tofly out.

"What?" Cromwell asked.

"No other car on the road sport that kind of feature, it's a signature of Berkovitz Electric," Swift answered his question swiftly.

[i]What is Berkovitz Electric?[/i] The colonel decided that wasn't important right now.

The billionaire fished out a slab of metal with the bitten apple logo on it. It looked sleek and slab, completely contrary to his expectation. In his experience, laptops were bulky portable computers usually made with plastics, not the thin slab of metal.

"What the hell is that?" Cromwell asked again.

"Like I told you, a laptop computer. I am sure you have Steve Job back on your Earth?"

The soldier nodded. It confirmed who the maker of the laptop.

"Let's head back in, to the second floor," the billionaire announced.

The trio headed back into the warehouse, with the Colonel's mind burning with technological possibilities. He wanted to get back home, but he also wanted to stay here and partake in the changes that had occurred seventeen years after the fact.

When the arrived at the set's meeting room, it was almost the same in its details. The special operator briefly thought that they had stolen this look from Stargate Command. He pushed it all down to see the evidence.    

Booting up, the startup sequence was very nice looking. The login screen and the desktop did not disappoint. It was beautiful to look at.

The billionaire quickly navigated to a folder and load an episode for viewing, "A Matter of Time".

"This is the episode when you die in a black hole. You won't have any trouble watching it?" the billionaire questioned.

"No, not at all," Cromwell said. "When I let go of that rope, I thought I was going to die anyway."
