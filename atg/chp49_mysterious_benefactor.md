How did a fictional device came into the fortunate possession of a billionaire, let alone that device connecting to an alternate dimension? It was a recipe for a good science fiction story, but it does not fit well within his experience of reality.

After two days of working to procure materials and fill out paperwork, he turned to his next objective: figure out what he can about Swift's benefactor, the person who gave the entrepreneur a working stargate.

"Do you know what he look like now?" Cromwell asked the billionaire.

"No, I am still drawing a blank" Swift admitted.

Cromwell groaned in frustration once again. He interrogated Swift backward and forward, to make sure that he wasn't concealing anything. He was pretty sure that the younger man wasn't lying, but there was always a blank about the dealer's description.

Even with the receipts, billings, emails, and GPS, the location was just the meeting place the seller met John Swift in. Facebook and social media was useless since the seller use a very common English name and personal information that he cannot easily verify. It was all that he could do as an amateur investigator.

"After an hour of trying to remember his face, I don't think you could."

"I swear that I could. It's so close, but I just couldn't," Swift protested.

"I believe you, but it looks like it's the limit of my investigation ability. I kill people for a living, not analyze intelligence."

"So what's next then?"

"I don't know. An MRI? Somebody might have messed with your brain."

Swift didn't look a bit happy about that. "I dislike the idea of someone noodling around my brain and my life."

"If you're sick, or someone did something to your mind, you need to see the doctor."

"I hate visiting the doctor," Swift muttered under his breath.

The billionaire visited Fraiser's clinic after much persuasion. He sat through needles and blood tests, physicals, medical scans, then through psychological tests.

Finally, Cromwell met with Doctor Fraiser, while the billionaire lie on a bed in a medical grown.

"Did we find anything?" Cromwell asked.

"The good news is that John Swift is very healthy. All results and tests come up normal. The bad news is that we can't find anything to suggest tempering."

Cromwell frown.

"No clues as to why I am blanking the seller of the stargate?" John Swift asked.

Fraiser shook her head. "It might be possible that we're missing something."

"Even with new medical knowledge?"

"Seventeen years of advance in medicine is a lot to go through. We also don't have the medical equipment."

Swift was crestfallen. "What's next, Colonel?"

"There's not a lot we can do until we have actual investigators," Cromwell replied. "General Hammond is concerned about leaking data, so we have to wait until the next diplomatic contact."
