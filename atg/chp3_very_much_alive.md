**Chapter Three: Very Much Alive**

***
**Colonel Johnathan O'Neill**
**SGC, SG-Earth**

"My name is Colonel Frank Cromwell of the United States Air Force. Service number is...." the man on the screen recited.

Surprise was part of the job at Stargate Command. That knowledge never really keep surprises from being surprises. This was one of them.

He couldn't believe what he was seeing on the screen. There's a dead man on the opposite side of the wormhole. He was speaking to the rover inside what appeared to be a copy of Stargate Command.

"Harriman, I need to speak with the Colonel," O'Neill ordered.

"Yes sir," the technician replied, before flipping the switch on the microphone. "You can speak now."

"This is Colonel Johnathan O'Neill of United States Stargate Command, it's good to see you."

"Good to see you as well," Colonel Frank Cromwell replied, still pointing his gun at the rover.

"However, I am not going to take your appearance and identity as granted. I am going to ask you questions that a SGC personnel should know. This should also verify that it's us as well."

O'Neill asked a series of question to which Cromwell answered to his satisfaction, including a secret question of whether Cromwell was under duress.

Then he finally got to ask a burning question. "Say, why are you standing what looked like a brightly lit Stargate Command?"

"It's not," Cromwell answered. "You are not going believe me-"

"I seen a lot of strange and unbelievable things at my time at Stargate Command."

"Very well. It's not Stargate Command, it's a television set for a series about us. I am in an alternate universe where our missions and lives are a television show, and it's the year two thousand fifteen. Or so what I been led to believe."

O'Neill froze in disbelief. "That sounds unbelievable even for what we encounter on the job."

"I could be delusional."

"No, I don't believe that your situation is out of the realm of possibility. One time, Doctor Jackson somehow ended up in an alternate universe via the reality mirror before we got him out."

It may be sheer improbability, but he cannot deny what he was seeing in front of his eyes, or what was coming from the rover. The problem was aligning his gut feeling with reality.

It didn't take long for General Hammond to get to the control room. His office wasn't far from here.

"Frank Cromwell, am I hearing this right? You ended up seventeen year into the future on an alternate Earth, where we are the subject of a television series?"

"Yes, I believe that's about right," Cromwell affirmed.

"The probability of encountering such a reality is incredibly low," Carter said. "To be the same in all the ways except that we are a science fiction series? It's far more likely that we would encounter a reality very similar to ours but just a tiny different. Even though that parallel realities posited by the many-world interpretation of quantum mechanics, we still have no working theories on how to actually cross one."

"And now we have verification of a method how to cross one," Hammond conjectured. "Aside from the reality mirror that was destroyed."

"Only if we can reliably replicate the method, sir. Frank Cromwell might still be stuck on the other side if he can't dial home and return. We only have less than forty-eight minutes before the gate shut down."

Hammond gritted his teeth. "If it come to the worst case scenario, Cromwell will be considered missing-in-action rather than dead."

A man came into the screen.

"I am a billionaire. I can arrange something for him for his stay on my Earth," an unidentified tall man spoken from the MALP. "Permanently if necessary."

"Thank you, but forgive me if I don't take your words for it," Hammond replied. He looked over to the rest of the team. "We'll assume for now that he can't reconnect with us and that there is no way to get him back. You have whatever time is left to chuck whatever is useful for him through the gate. Make it quick."

"Yes, sir," SG-1 replied with a grimace.

"Colonel Cromwell, if you can, please try a reconnection as soon as you can. To give you enough time, we'll try to reconnect to your address after ten minutes."

O'Neill didn't think whatever was chucked into the gate was going to help Cromwell much if any. If anything, the 'billionaire' is probably his friend's best bet.

But he wasn't about to do absolutely nothing if he could do something.

**Colonel Frank Cromwell**
**Hawthorne, Infopunk-Earth**

It didn't take long for Cromwell to improvise, neither was it tough to get both men working with him to get him home. Although they insisted that Cromwell carry a laptop to return home with.

"Ready?" John Swift said via radio.

"Copy that. I am ready," Cromwell said.

The wormhole connected.

"This is Cromwell. SGC, do you copy?" he radioed.

"Copy. The iris is now open. You are free to proceed," the voice on the other side said.

Cromwell walked boldly into the gate. Then, he suddenly saw people in hazmat suits.

"Follow me," one of them said.

He complied.

**September 17, 1998**

Cromwell was finally in the meeting room with SG-1 and General Hammond. He endured a twenty four hours isolation period, with stringent medical check by the the medical staff, and a few hours of boredom before this meeting.

There was a macbook in the middle of the desk. Everyone was staring at it.

"It's good to have you back, Colonel," Hammond said warmly.

"Likewise."

"I am happy to let you know that we reconnected with the alternate Earth repeatedly and that there's no problem going back and forth. Carter and her team still don't know how long the connection will last, but it's looking like it's permanent."

Cromwell smiled. He thought long and hard about what an alternate Earth might provide to SGC and his Earth and probably so did everyone else. That did not exclude the alternate Earth being a threat but it was at low probability.

"I believe everyone here viewed the science fiction series?" Cromwell asked.

There were mixed reactions from SG-1.

"They left out the other half of the team!" O'Neill complained. "Although the humors and camaradies were spot on."

"Mostly inaccurate," Teal'c said.

"Obviously they're not physicists," Carter said.

"Haha, I knew we were a science fiction series," Kawalsky said, before his face turned into a frown. "Although I died right after pilot episode."

"It's entertainment," Cromwell conceded. "But it could be useful as an intelligence mine. We just need to be on guard about making assumptions."

"What if we are in the field having to make split second decision?" O'Neill countered. "We will gather all the knowledge we know to date. The intel could save us, but it could also kill us. SG-1 and any members of the SGC shouldn't had watch the videos in the first place."

"At the time we received the device and watch the videos contained on there, we only checked if it was an obvious bomb or biohazardous material. Nobody made any objection about contamination using future information, however inaccurate it may be on many points," Hammond noted. "Nonetheless, the mistake can't be undone. We'll have to move on to make use of or neutralize dangerous information. I want every piece of the franchise analyzed to the last scrap for any useful intelligence. It will be analyzed independently by separate teams not from SGC so that their conclusion will not be contaminated. Is there any objections or concerns?"

"How fast could we get it done?" Cromwell asked.

"It will be a priority project, and it will be done as soon as possible. I am assuming that we will extract the intel from the laptop for use by multiple teams. If we can get Mr. Swift's cooperation, I am sure we will receive more videos from their franchise."

The most convenient place to eat was the SGC's cafeteria. It wasn't gourmet food, but it wasn't bad either. O'Neill may be paid six figures plus hazard duty pay, but he wasn't going to go out every time to get food. There was a security process with the need to stay here in case if emergency arise.

Frank Cromwell approached his table with a cafeteria tray.

"May I join you?" Cromwell asked.

"Sure," O'Neill replied.

"About the war in Iraq..."

"Don't say anymore. Whatever happened or didn't happen there, it's over."

"Forgiveness?"

"Maybe not even that. If what you said is true, then there's nothing to forgive. You made a judgement call on that day, and it was wrong. Only weeks ago, you saved the world, so I can't exactly complaine about being personally tortured in some forsaken Iraqi prison."

"If I had to do it over again, I would drag you back to the helicopter."

"I know you would."

"So, we're good?"

O'Neill looked into Cromwell's eyes. "Yeah, we're good."

***

It occurred to Frank Cromwell that the office of Major General Hammond was very ordinary. If he didn't know, it looked like the office of any general, but this office belonged to one of the most important and special combatant command on Earth.

"Have a seat, Colonel," Hammond said.

Cromwell could see the exasperated gesture exhibited by the general.

"What am I going to do with you?" Hammond said.. "You know how much headache is when a SGC personnel come back from the dead? Luckily I didn't have to find out until now. Doctor Jackson was only gone a few hours before we retrieved him from an aquatic alien. But you have been gone for a few weeks. A funeral was already conducted and all the paperwork was done."

"So this is going to be a problem."

"Yes, a very big nasty problem. This is by no mean your fault, but coming from the dead plays hell with keeping a program secret. You are a Colonel. You had been in contact with innumerable people, many of which has came to your funeral. They're going to ask a question, 'why are you alive?'. We're going to have to craft a very convincing story as to why. That would be a lot easier if we were officially at war with someone else on this planet. Thankfully, we are not. "

"So, I am not going back to my old life."

"I didn't say that we are going to just throw up our hands up and do nothing."

"Sir, wouldn't it be easier that it just wasn't going to happen? At least until a few years?"

"You'll be stuck here in this base. There's no telling when we will reveal the program to the public."

"In the television series, they never made stargate command public, even when they finally have the capability to manufacture the ships needed to defend Earth. It was all up to SG-1 to save the day again and again. I hope we are not going in that direction."

"I assure you that we will not. If one of our carrier strike group got sunk, or there was a battle in Antartica, we would absolutely disclose the stargate program to the public. It would be the height of stupidity, not to mention jeopardizing the safety of this world, to not do so."

"It's good to hear. I have a proposal. I was thinking of going to two thousand fifteen. We are in contact with a prominent billionaire, probably with good connection to our, I mean, his government. He could arrange a meeting. When we do contact the government, I could be a liaison to the USAF there. When the program finally become public, I'll get my life back."

"I have one objection that just came to my mind. You are a known face."

"A fictional person there, sir. At most I would get mistaken as the actor who played me."

"I'll see what I can do, but I make no promises."

**Captain Samantha Carter**

Captain Samantha Carter was somewhat computer literate, enough to operate safely on her own without immediately panicking. However, computing and tech support wasn't what she did for a living. That duty belonged to Chief Master Sergeant Harriman. The laptop of the future were in front of them, and he was the one operating the device, but even he has a slightly difficult time getting to where he needs to go.

"Where do I go right now?" Harriman said, speaking to a face on the screen.

"You'll want to register an account at gmail dot com," Swift, the billionaire said. "That will be your email account."

"Got it."

Carter sat through it, proactively asking questions along the way, and taking part getting used to this futuristic device with its blazing fast gigabit connection delivered wirelessly through the gate. It was certainly a far cry from her dialup connection that she was used to.

Finally, Harriman was gone. She was all alone, with Swift still reachable if she need to ask an question.

She started typing an email to a professor that she knew.

A thought occurred to her? Physics might be different on their Earth. No, if that was true, why was the computer in front of her still working, downloading and transmitting information. For that matter, where did the gate came from?

No. That wasn't relevant to what she need to do. She put those thought aside, and set to work.
