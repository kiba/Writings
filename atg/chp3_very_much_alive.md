**Chapter Three: Very Much Alive**

**Colonel Johnathan O'Neill**
**SGC, SG-Earth**

"My name is Colonel Frank Cromwell of the United States Air Force. Service number is...." the man on the screen recited.

Surprise was part of the job at Stargate Command. Somehow that fact never really kept surprise from happening on a frequent basis.

He couldn't believe what he was seeing on the screen. There's a dead man on the opposite side of the wormhole speaking to the rover inside what appeared to be a copy of Stargate Command.

"Harriman, I need to speak with the Colonel," O'Neil ordered.

"Understood sir," the technician replied, before flipping the switch on the microphone. "You can speak now, Colonel."

"This is Colonel Johnathan O'Neil of United States Stargate Command, it's good to see you."

"Good to see you as well," Colonel Frank Cromwell replied, still pointing his gun at the rover.

"However, I am not going to take your appearance and identity as granted. I am going to ask you questions that a SGC personnel should know. This should also verify that it's us as well."

O'Neil asked a series of question to which Cromwell answered to his satisfaction, including a secret question of whether Cromwell was under duress.

Then he finally got to ask a burning question. "Say, why are you standing what looked like a brightly lit Stargate Command?"

"It's not," Cromwell answered. "You are not going believe me-"

"I seen a lot of strange and unbelievable things at my time at Stargate Command."

"Very well. It's not Stargate Command, it's a television set for a series about us. I am in an alternate universe where our missions and lives are a television show, and it's the year two thousand sixteen. Or so what I been led to believe."

O'Neil froze in disbelief. "I don't believe it."

"I could be delusional."

"No, it's not out of the realm of possibility. Doctor Jackson somehow ended up in an alternate universe via the reality mirror before we got him out. But right now, I just don't believe it."

It may be sheer improbability, but he cannot deny what he seen in front of his eyes, or what was coming from the rover. The problem was aligning his gut feeling with reality.

Naturally, with an incident like this, General Hammond was called in.

"Frank Cromwell, am I hearing this right? You ended up seventeen year into the future on an alternate Earth, where we are the subject of a science fiction series?"

"Yes, you heard that right."

"The probability of encountering such a reality is incredibly low," Carter said. "Although we still have no theories on how to cross one."

"And now we have verification of a method how to cross one," Hammond said.

"Only if we can reliably replicate the method, sir. Frank Cromwell might still be stuck on the other side if he can't dial home and return. We only have an hour of time before the gate shut down."

"I doubt we can do anything under incredible time constraint. If it comes to worst case scenario, Cromwell will be considered missing in action again."

"I am a billionaire. I can arrange something for him for his stay on my Earth," an unidentified tall man spoken from the MALP. "Permanently if necessary."

"Forgive me if I don't take your words for it," Hammond replied. He looked over to the rest of the team. "We'll assume for now that he can't reconnect with us and that there is  way to get him back. You have whatever left to chuck whatever is useful for him through the gate. Make it quick."

"Yes, sir," SG-1 replied with a grimace.

"Colonel Cromwell, if you can, please try a reconnection as soon as you can. To give you enough time, we'll try to reconnect to your address after ten minutes."

O'Neill didn't think whatever was chucked into the gate was going to help Cromwell much if any. If anything, the 'billionaire' is probably his friend's best bet.

It wasn't long that an agreement was quickly made that Cromwell should go home, although with a macbook in his hand.

"Ready?" John Swift said via radio.

"Copy that. I am ready," Cromwell said.

The wormhole connected.

"You are good to go."

Cromwell walked boldly into the gate. Then, he suddenly saw people in hazmat suits.

"Follow me," one of them said.

He complied.

Cromwell was finally in the meeting room with SG-1 and General Hammond. He endured a twenty four hours isolation period, with stringent medical check by the the medical staff.

There was a macbook in the middle of the desk. Everyone was staring at it.

"It's good to have you back, Colonel," Hammond said warmly.

"Likewise."

"I am happy to let you know that we reconnected with the alternate Earth repeatedly and that there's no problem going back and forth. Carter and her team still don't know how long the connection will last."

Cromwell smiled. He thought long and hard about what an alternate Earth might provide to SGC and his Earth and probably so did everyone else. That did not exclude the alternate Earth being a threat but it was low probability.

"I believe everyone here viewed the science fiction series?" Cromwell asked.

There were mixed reactions from SG-1.

"They left out the other half of the team!" O'Neill complained. "Although the humors and camaradies were spot on."

"Mostly inaccurate," Teal'c said.

"Obviously they're not physicists," Carter said.

"Haha, I knew we were a science fiction series," Kawalsky said, before his face turned into a frown. "Although I died right after pilot episode."

"It's entertainment," Cromwell conceded. "But it could be useful as an intelligence mine. We just need to be on guard about making assumptions."

"What if we are in the field having to make split second decision?" O'Neill countered. "We will gather all the knowledge we know to date. The intel could save us, but it could also kill us. SG-1 and any members of the SGC shouldn't had watch the videos in the first place."

"At the time we received the device and watch the videos contained on there, we only checked if it was an obvious bomb or biohazardous material. Nobody made any objection about contamination using future information, however inaccurate it may be on many points," Hammond noted. "Nonetheless, the mistake can't be undone. We'll have to move on to make use of or neutralize dangerous information. I want every piece of the franchise analyzed to the last scrap for any useful intelligence. It will be analyzed independently by separate teams not from SGC so that their conclusion will not be contaminated. Is there any objections or concerns?"

"How fast could we get it done?" Cromwell asked.

"It will be a priority project, and it will be done as soon as possible. I am assuming that we will extract the intel from the laptop for use by multiple teams. If we can get Mr. Swift's cooperation, I am sure we will receive more videos from their franchise."

The most convenient place to eat was the SGC's cafeteria. It wasn't gourmet food, but it wasn't bad either. O'Neill may be paid six figures plus hazard duty pay, but he wasn't going to go out every time to get food. There was a security process with the need to stay here in case if emergency arise.

Frank Cromwell approached his table with a cafeteria tray.

"May I join you?" Cromwell asked.

"Sure," O'Neil replied.

"About the war in Iraq..."

"Don't say anymore. Whatever happened there, it's over."

"Forgiveness?"

"Maybe not even that. If what you said is true, then there's nothing to forgive. You already saved our ass by sacrificing yourself, so I can't exactly complain about being stuck in Iraqi prison if the world was almost destroyed."

"If I had to do it over again, I would drag you back to the helicopter."

"I know you would."

"So, we're good?" O'Neill looked into Cromwell's eyes.

"Yeah, we're good." He nodded.

Captain Samantha Carter has some level of computing skills, enough to operate safely on her own without panicking. She was not a tech support person. That duty belong to Chief Master Segrent Harriman who was seated right next to her, working the computer which came from 2016, therefore sporting user interface and ideas that were not all that present in nineteen ninety-eight.

"Where do I go right now?" Harriman said.
