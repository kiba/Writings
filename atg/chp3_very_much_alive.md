**Chapter Three: Very Much Alive**

**Colonel Johnathan O'Neill**
**SGC, SG-Earth**

"My name is Colonel Frank Cromwell of the United States Air Force. Service number is...." the man on the screen recited.

Surprise was part of the job at Stargate Command. Somehow that fact never really kept surprise from happening on a frequent basis.

He couldn't believe what he was seeing on the screen. There's a dead man on the opposite side of the wormhole speaking to the rover inside what appeared to be a copy of Stargate Command.

"Harriman, I need to speak with the Colonel," O'Neil ordered.

"Understood sir," the technician replied, before flipping the switch on the microphone. "You can speak now, Colonel."

"This is Colonel Johnathan O'Neil of United States Stargate Command, it's good to see you."

"Good to see you as well," Colonel Frank Cromwell replied, still pointing his gun at the rover.

"However, I am not going to take your appearance and identity as granted. I am going to ask you questions that a SGC personnel should know. This should also verify that it's us as well."

O'Neil asked a series of question to which Cromwell answered to his satisfaction, including a secret question of whether Cromwell was under duress.

Then he finally got to ask a burning question. "Say, why are you standing what looked like a brightly lit Stargate Command?"

"It's not," Cromwell answered. "You are not going believe me-"

"I seen a lot of strange and unbelievable things at my time at Stargate Command."

"Very well. It's not Stargate Command, it's a television set for a series about us. I am in an alternate universe where our missions and lives are a television show, and it's the year two thousand sixteen. Or so what I been led to believe."

O'Neil froze in disbelief. "I don't believe it."

"I could be delusional."

"No, it's not out of the realm of possibility. Doctor Jackson somehow ended up in an alternate universe via the reality mirror before we got him out. But right now, I just don't believe it."

It may be sheer improbability, but he cannot deny what he seen in front of his eyes, or what was coming from the rover. The problem was aligning his gut feeling with reality.

Naturally, with an incident like this, General Hammond was called in.

"Frank Cromwell, am I hearing this right? You ended up seventeen year into the future on an alternate Earth, where we are the subject of a science fiction series?"

"Yes, you heard that right."

"The probability of encountering such a reality is incredibly low," Carter said. "Although we still have no theories on how to cross one."

"And now we have verification of a method how to cross one," Hammond said.

"Only if we can reliably replicate the method, sir. Frank Cromwell might still be stuck on the other side if he can't dial home and return. We only have an hour of time before the gate shut down."

"I doubt we can do anything under incredible time constraint. If it comes to worst case scenario, Cromwell will be considered missing in action again."

"I am a billionaire. I can arrange something for him for his stay on my Earth," an unidentified tall man spoken from the MALP. "Permanently if necessary."

"Forgive me if I don't take your words for it," Hammond replied. He looked over to the rest of the team. "We'll assume for now that he can't reconnect with us and that there is  way to get him back. You have whatever left to chuck whatever is useful for him through the gate. Make it quick."

"Yes, sir," SG-1 replied with a grimace.

"Colonel Cromwell, if you can, please try a reconnection as soon as you can. To give you enough time, we'll try to reconnect to your address after ten minutes."

O'Neill didn't think whatever was chucked into the gate was going to help Cromwell much if any. If anything, the 'billionaire' is probably his friend's best bet.

It wasn't long that an agreement was quickly made that Cromwell should go home, although with a macbook in his hand.

"Ready?" John Swift said via radio.

"Copy that. I am ready," Cromwell said.

The wormhole connected.

"You are good to go."

Cromwell walked boldly into the gate. Then, he suddenly saw people in hazmat suits.

"Follow me," one of them said.

He complied.

Cromwell was finally in the meeting room with SG-1 and General Hammond. He endured a twenty four hours isolation period, with stringent medical check by the the medical staff.

There was a macbook in the middle of the desk. Everyone was staring at it.

"It's good to have you back, Colonel," Hammond said warmly.

"Likewise."

"I am happy to let you know that we had reconnected with the alternate Earth repeatedly and that there's no problem going back and forth."

Cromwell smiled. He thought long and hard about what an alternate Earth might provide to SGC and his Earth.
