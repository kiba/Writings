# Chapter Three: Very Much Alive

***
**Colonel Johnathan O'Neill**
**SGC, SG-Earth**

"My name is Colonel Frank Cromwell of the United States Air Force. Service number is...." the man on the screen recited.

Surprise was part of the job at Stargate Command, but knowing that never really diminish the surprise factor.

O'Neill couldn't believe what he was seeing on the screen. There's a dead man on the opposite side of the wormhole. He was speaking to the rover inside what appeared to be a copy of Stargate Command.

"Harriman, I need to speak with the Colonel," O'Neill ordered.

"Yes sir," the technician said as he flipped the switch on the microphone. "You can speak now."

"This is Colonel Johnathan O'Neill of United States Stargate Command, it's good to see you."

"Good to see you as well," Colonel Frank Cromwell replied, still pointing his gun at the rover.

"However, I am not going to take your appearance and identity as granted. I am going to ask you questions that a SGC personnel should know. This should also verify that it's us as well."

O'Neill asked a series of questions to which Cromwell answered to his satisfaction, including a secret question of whether Cromwell was under duress or not.

Then he finally got to ask a burning question. "Say, why are you standing in what looked like a brightly lit Stargate Command?"

"It's not," Cromwell answered. "You are not going believe me."

"Try me."

"It's absolutely not Stargate Command, but it's a set of a television series called 'Stargate SG-1'. I am in an alternate universe where our missions and lives are a complete work of fiction in the year two thousand fifteen. Or so what I been led to believe."

O'Neill nearly froze in disbelief. "That's something...new. It's hard to believe."

"I could be delusional."

"Given what I have seen in the past, I can't dismiss it out of hand. Doctor Jackson got himself trapped in an alternate universe before we pulled him out of the reality mirror."

Part of O'Neill still wondered if Cromwell is alive, even after he answered all his questions to his satisfaction.

Years of special operation has taught him that ignoring reality was likely to lead to very bad things. Yet, there was a rule that was like a law of physics. People who died remained very dead. Cromwell seem to have broke this rule, but O'Neill never actually saw him die. So he has to believe what what we seeing in front of his eyes.

Frank Cromwell isn't dead.

It didn't take long for General Hammond to get here, as his office was located nearby in this underground complex.

"Colonel Cromwell, am I hearing this right? You ended up seventeen year into the future on an alternate Earth, where we are the subject of a television series?"

"Yes, I believe that's about right," Cromwell affirmed.

"The probability of encountering such a reality is incredibly low," Carter said. "To be the same in all the ways except that we are a science fiction series? It's far more likely that we would encounter a reality very similar to ours but just a tiny different. Even though that parallel realities are posited by the many-world interpretation of quantum mechanics, we still have no working theories on how to actually cross one."

"And now we have verification of a working method how to cross one?" Hammond conjectured. "We already encountered alternate realities using the Reality Mirror, but that got destroyed."

"Only if we can reliably replicate the method, sir. Frank Cromwell might still be stuck on the other side if he can't dial home and return. We only have less than thirty-eight minutes before the gate shut down."

Hammond gritted his teeth. "If it come to the worst case scenario, Cromwell will be considered missing-in-action rather than dead."

A man came into the screen.

"I am a billionaire. I can arrange something for him for his stay on my Earth," an unidentified tall man spoken from the MALP. "Permanently if necessary."

"Thank you, but forgive me if I don't take your words for it," Hammond replied. He looked over to the rest of the team. "We'll assume for now that he can't reconnect with us and that there is no way to get him back. You have whatever time is left to chuck whatever you think is useful for him through the gate. Make it quick."

"Yes, sir," SG-1 replied with a grimace.

"Colonel Cromwell, if you can, please try a reconnection as soon as you can. To give you enough time, we'll try to reconnect to your address after ten minutes."

O'Neill didn't think whatever was chucked into the gate was going to help Cromwell much if any. If anything, the 'billionaire' is probably his friend's best bet.

But he wasn't about to do absolutely nothing if he could do something to help him.

**Colonel Frank Cromwell**
**Hawthorne, Infopunk-Earth**

There was no way for Cromwell to walk back home without first reconnecting from his side of the gate. Furthermore, he was also warned that a reconnection might not work, with the strong probability of forever being stranded here. So, the SGC did the only thing they could do. They begun chucking survival kits, MREs, and weapons.

"What we do now?" Swift asked.

"I'll get the stuff sorted, but I want to be ready to reconnect as soon as possible."

"You want to go home. I'll make sure that you go home."

"Thanks."

"But first, I want you to have my laptop."

"Excuse me?"

"If your reality is anything like the stargate series, you guys have a tough road ahead. I can at least spare you a latest generation computer."

It wasn't long before Cromwell held a laptop in his hand. Stuff were still being chucked, but that wasn't important. If he was truly stuck in this place, he could organize it later. If not, then somebody will have to haul the items back to base.

The gate shut down unceremoniously, only for the gate to start rotating again.

"Please step back far away from the hazard line, Colonel," Swift said. Cromwell compiled. Better to have extra margin then to die.

The gate connected. It worked! He could finally go home!

"Ready?" John Swift said via radio.

"Copy that. I am ready," Cromwell said.

"This is Cromwell. SGC, do you copy?" he radioed.

"Copy. The iris is now open. You are free to proceed," the voice on the other side said.

Cromwell walked into the gate, instantaneously emerging on the other side. For a brief moment, he felt an euphoria that he was home.

A person in an orange hazmat suit made their appearance after a blast door opened.

"Follow me," a female voice ordered.

He complied.

The airman entered a quarantine room, an artifact of the visit to the land of light. That mission got the entire SGC on lockdown, forcing new security and medical procedure to be added
to prevent such recurrence.

"It's very good to see you alive," Fraiser said, before handing him a hospital gown.

"I can say the same for you, doctor," Cromwell replied as Fraiser put her hands on the back of the neck, checking for opportunistic infection by a Goa'uld parasite.

"Take a shower. After that, we're going to do a lot of medical tests to verify that you are who you are and to make sure that you're healthy. That's going to take a long time."

"Yes ma'am."

***
**September 17, 1998**

There was a lot of poking and prodding by the medical staff. Then Cromwell endured a full twenty-four hour quarantine. Debriefing was done remotely, via the intercom, but that didn't last long. Thankfully, there were entertainment options to keep the boredom at bay. At time he would watch television, or read books, though frequently, he would just contemplate his experience, writing in a journal.

Finally, he was let go.

It had been weeks for Stargate personnels, but not for him. He was only been out of the complex for a few hours at most, returning as soon as possible.

There wasn't much to miss.

His stomach beckoned the call for lunch, and it was only hours until the scheduled meeting with General Hammond and SG-1.

He rode the elevator to the cafeteria.

On the left on his entrance was O'Neill's team. Colonel O'Neill's face brighten up.

"Look who's back?" O'Neill announced loudly, getting everyone's attention. "Cromwell is alive and well! Three cheers and a toast!"

Cromwell smiled slightly. It leave no doubt that the SGC is a true community that cared for one another, even if Cromwell didn't feel the same way about himself. He was glad that he was alive, but from their perspective, he was supposed to be dead. They had conducted his funeral not too long ago.

***

The SGC dealt with galactic affair, yet Lieutenant Major General George Hammond's office was as ordinary as it could get. There's no visible alien tech inside this office just yet, or what he could see. However, Cromwell knew that this command was only two years old, that's not a whole lot of time to develop technologies.

There's also an extra person in this room beside Hammond and himself, a man named Irvine Fletcher, the SGC's counsel. A mostly bald man in his fifty, this man mostly melted in the background, checking over everything from agreement with aliens to non-disclosure agreement made with civilian contractors and employees.

"Have a seat, Colonel," Hammond said. Already, he could see the weary look on Hammond's face. "What am I going to do with you? Through no fault of your own, you came back from the dead."

Fletcher nodded and adjusted his glasses. "Our assumption is that you died in the black hole. Accordingly, a death certificate was issued, assets were transferred to an estate, and your will is taken care of. You no longer have a penny to your name and you don't exist in the eyes of the court."

Cromwell nearly choked on that. Everything he earned for his entire life is simply gone, because everyone assume that no one can survive being sucked in by a black hole. According to Carter, there's no reason to expect that the black hole would transport him to an alternate universe, let alone a reality that considered this reality part of a fictional universe.

"So this is going to be a problem," Cromwell replied.

"It is," Hammond said. "Beside your legal troubles, it also plays hell with keeping a program secret. You are a Colonel. You had been in contact with innumerable people, many of which has came to your funeral. They're going to ask a question, 'why are you alive?'. We're going to have to craft a very convincing story as to why. That would be a lot easier if we were officially at war with someone else on this planet. Thankfully, we are not."

"So, I am not going back to my old life."

"I didn't say that we are going to just throw up our hands up and do nothing."

"The Air Force is willing to provide you with lawyers or help pay for them to help with your legal case," Fletcher said. "Of course, there's a balancing act to keep the program secret."

"During that time, I am stuck in a limbo?"

"Unfortunately, yes," Fletcher admitted. "You are also not under contract nor obligation to serve in the United States Air Force. If you decided not to work for the SGC or the air force, the SGC is willing to provide cost-of-living stipend plus pension and a temporary identity so that you can find wo-."

"I am not going to do that," Cromwell said. "From my perspective, I had only left the SGC hours at most."

"You will also acquire a temporary identity if you decide to work here, but you will be paid O-6 with the years you served accordingly," Fletcher continued where he left off. The colonel knew that he will earned more than most Americans, but it still stung to lose everything he had worked for.

"For the sake of secrecy, you will not contact anybody or anyone outside of the SGC community," Hammond added. "This is temporary until we have a cover story for you."

Fletcher handed Cromwell a non-disclosure agreement. "You will need to sign this. For now, you are not considered a member of the military. I am working to change this as soon as possible."

While most people would sign right away, the colonel read over it. He knew that it was a standard agreement handed out to civilians.

***

The news coming from Hammond and Fletcher was bad and unexpected, but Frank Cromwell wasn't the kind of man to dwell in misery. As far as he was concerned, the command had taken care of his short term needs and more. They really take care of people. He may not be retiring any time soon, but the airman has it in his mind to keep going as long as possible. He couldn't scarcely imagine what he will do as a retired man. Teach military history?

Still, there was one thing lingering in the back of his mind; his relation with an estranged friend and colleague, O'Neill. The legendary leader of SG-1 has showed every indication of having changed his mind, no longer showing any resentment toward him or throwing barbs his way. Still, in Cromwell's mind, it remained unresolved.

Cromwell approached O'Neill in a hallway.

"Can I talk with you for a second?" Cromwell asked.

"Sure," O'Neill replied, before detouring to an unoccupied room.

"About the war in Iraq..."

"Whatever happened there, I sort of got over it."

"Because I saved the world and sacrificed myself?"

"Yeah," O'Neill admitted, nodding. "I don't know if I believe or forgive you. Maybe I couldn't. It didn't change that I ended up in that Iraqi prison. I am sure you know what they did to prisoners there."

"Yeah. The Iraqi don't care about the geneva convention or any laws of war. They torture people. Even with SRE training, there's no way I could know idea the extent of the pain you felt."

"What it feel like to die? Was there any pain?"

"No. I made my peace in that instance, fully knowing that there's no god or heaven for me. There wasn't any pain until I awake on the other side."

"You're a brave man."

"There was no choice. You would have done the same thing in my situation, God or no God."

"Yeah, I would."

"And about Iraq?"

"I decided I have to move on. I can forgive you even if I still sometime live the nightmare."

"So we're good?"

O'Neill looked into the eyes of his friend. "Yeah. We're good."

Members from SG-1 was arrayed on one side of the conference table. General Hammond sat in the middle. Cromwell sat across from SG-1.

"First of all, I am happy to announce that we are able to repeatedly reconnect with the alternate Earth," Hammond said. "All telemetry is nominal and that there is no indication that this alternate Earth will get sucked in by a black hole any time soon." There were a few chuckles at that. "Carter and her team still don't know how long-term this connection is, but I hoped that it will be permanent."

Cromwell smiled at that news. Combining two populations in the fight against the Goa'uld would be welcome news. Of course, there was a possibility that this alternate Earth might be hostile or a threat, but that was rated very low.

Hammond turned his eyes toward Carter. "Can you give a summary on the connection situation?"

"As the general said earlier, we do not understand enough to give any estimate or explain the mechanic of the connection," Doctor Carter confirmed. "We do not know how to distinguish between alternate universes, though we are investigating several hypothesis. As such, I will not give any promises."

"Thank you. We will come back on that later," Hammond said, as he leafed through the next item. "We stopped examination of the videos. O'Neill, can you summarize why for the rest of us?"

"Yes sir. The videos are not consistent with our history, experience, and training, yet they continually lined up with the truth," O'Neill explained. "However, they are not reliable enough that they could be taken as gospel. We only watched a few episodes before I ordered everyone to stop watching them, but the damage is already done. Consciously or not, we will make use of the videos to inform our actions into the future. There's no telling whether our actions will save our life or cost us as a result of what we learned from the videos."

"Colonel O'Neill made the correct decision," Hammond said. "That's why I repeated his order to the entire base. I also talked to the President to recommend that anyone involved be barred from those videos. However, it cannot be denied that the videos might contain precious intelligence about the future. Somebody will need to analyze the information, but it will not be the usual teams assigned to Stargate Command or to the program. It will need to be done by analysts with no knowledge of the gate and the galaxy at large, or the existence of this program. That is what I ordered and requested. Any questions?"

"Is this a priority project?" Cromwell wondered.

"Yes. It will need to be done as soon as possible, as throughly as possible in order for us to make use of it." Nobody else has any more questions, so Hammond moved on. "Turning back on the topic, we'll need a game plan for short, medium, and long term, taking into account if and when the connection breaks or if it does not."

"I would like to make one suggestion," Cromwell said immediately. "I would like to volunteer."

"Pardon me?"

"Are you crazy?" O'Neill added.

"My life outside this wall is ruined, and there's no guarantee that I will get my life back before disclosure even with all the help that I will be getting. On the other hand, I am already on friendly term with someone native to that planet, and I could liaison with their military once we get into contact."

"You're asking me to risk a Colonel with all the skills and experiences that entailed," Hammond said.

"Sir, I would like to point out that SG-1 is composed of three different department heads, and a defector who's the former commander for a Goa'uld system lord, yet you send them out into the galaxy at large. I also know you're going to risk somebody sooner or later, especially if Carter did not find out any time soon and that the address shows no sign of instability."

"It's too early to consider who we will be sending to the alternate Earth, but understand I will make the final personnel selection. Back to the main topic at hand, I believe that the long term goal is to build an alliance with this Earth, especially our counterpart, though I don't believe that unification is an impossibility...."

The meeting went on, highlighting possibilities and ideas, as well downsides and failure modes. No firm decisions were made, but everyone was keenly aware of the possible benefit of a new ally very open to cooperation.

**Captain Samantha Carter**

Captain Samantha Carter was somewhat computer literate, enough to operate safely on her own without immediately panicking. However, computing and tech support wasn't what she did for a living. That duty belonged to Chief Master Sergeant Harriman. The laptop of the future was in front of them, and he was the one operating the device, but even he has a slightly difficult time getting to where he needs to go.

"Where do I go right now?" Harriman said, speaking to a face on the screen.

"You'll want to register an account at gmail dot com," Swift, the billionaire said. "That will be your email account."

"Got it."

Carter sat through it, proactively asking questions along the way, and taking part in getting used to this futuristic device. Its connection was ahead of its time even on Swift's Earth, with its gigabit connection. It was certainly a far cry from her dialup connection that she was used to.

Finally, Harriman was gone after a long tutoring session. She was all alone, with Swift still reachable if she need to ask an question.

She started typing an email to a professor that she knew.

A stray thought occurred to her. She might be a crackpot on the other Earth. No, if that was true, why was the computer in front of her still working, downloading and transmitting information?

More importantly, if she could understand a physic paper even with her outdated knowledge, then it must be that the physics are most likely the same.

Relieved, Carter continued writing the email.
