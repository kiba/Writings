**Chapter Three: Very Much Alive**

"My name is Colonel Frank Cromwell of the United States Air Force. Service number is...." the man on the screen recited.

Surprise was part of the job at Stargate Command. Somehow that fact never really kept surprise from happening on a frequent basis.

He couldn't believe what he was seeing on the screen. There's a dead man on the opposite side of the wormhole speaking to the rover inside what appeared to be a copy of Stargate Command.

"Harriman, I need to speak with the Colonel," O'Neil ordered.

"Understood sir," the technician replied, before flipping the switch on the microphone. "You can speak now, Colonel."

"This is Colonel Johnathan O'Neil of United States Stargate Command, it's good to see you."

"Good to see you as well," Colonel Frank Cromwell replied, still pointing his gun at the rover.

"However, I am not going to take your appearance and identity as granted. I am going to ask you questions that a SGC personnel should know. This should also verify that it's us as well."

O'Neil asked a series of question to which Cromwell answered to his satisfaction, including a secret question of whether Cromwell was under duress.

Then he finally got to ask a burning question. "Say, why are you standing what looked like a brightly lit Stargate Command?"

"It's not," Cromwell answered. "You are not going believe me-"

"I seen a lot of strange and unbelievable things at my time at Stargate Command."

"Very well. It's not Stargate Command, it's a television set for a series about us. I am in an alternate universe where our missions and lives are a television show, and it's the year two thousand sixteen. Or so what I been led to believe."

O'Neil froze in disbelief. "I don't believe it."

"I could be delusional."

"No, it's not out of the realm of possibility. Doctor Jackson somehow ended up in an alternate universe via the reality mirror before we got him out. But right now, I just don't believe it."

It may be sheer improbability, but he cannot deny what he seen in front of his eyes, or what was coming from the rover. The problem was aligning his gut feeling with reality.

"You're telling me that Frank Cromwell is not well and alive, but he ended up seventeen years into the future in a reality where we are the subject of a science fiction series?" Hammond asked with incredulity.

"Yes sir, that is what the Colonel told me," O'Neil replied.

"The probability of encountering such a reality is incredibly low," Carter said. "Although we still have no theories on how to cross one."

"And now we have verification of a method how to cross one," Hammond said.

"Only if we can reliably replicate the method, sir. Frank Cromwell might still be stuck on the other side if he can't dial home and return. We only have thirty eight minutes before the gate shut down."
