**Chapter Three: Very Much Alive**

***
**Colonel Johnathan O'Neill**
**SGC, SG-Earth**

"My name is Colonel Frank Cromwell of the United States Air Force. Service number is...." the man on the screen recited.

Surprise was part of the job at Stargate Command. Simply knowing that surprises was going to happen never really diminish the surprise factor.

He couldn't believe what he was seeing on the screen. There's a dead man on the opposite side of the wormhole. He was speaking to the rover inside what appeared to be a copy of Stargate Command.

"Harriman, I need to speak with the Colonel," O'Neill ordered.

"Yes sir," the technician replied, before flipping the switch on the microphone. "You can speak now."

"This is Colonel Johnathan O'Neill of United States Stargate Command, it's good to see you."

"Good to see you as well," Colonel Frank Cromwell replied, still pointing his gun at the rover.

"However, I am not going to take your appearance and identity as granted. I am going to ask you questions that a SGC personnel should know. This should also verify that it's us as well."

O'Neill asked a series of question to which Cromwell answered to his satisfaction, including a secret question of whether Cromwell was under duress.

Then he finally got to ask a burning question. "Say, why are you standing in what looked like a brightly lit Stargate Command?"

"It's not," Cromwell answered. "You are not going believe me."

"Try me."

"It's absolutely not Stargate Command, but it's a set of a television series called 'Stargate SG-1'. I am in an alternate universe where our missions and lives are a complete work of fiction and it's the year two thousand fifteen. Or so what I been led to believe."

O'Neill nearly froze in disbelief. "That's something...new. It's hard to believe."

"I could be delusional."

"No, but given what I have seen, I can't dismiss it out of hand. Doctor Jackson got himself trapped in an alternate reality before we pulled him out of the reality mirror before it got destroyed."

Just when O'Neill was starting to make peace with Cromwell being dead, he couldn't believe that his friend appeared from out of nowhere, seemly alive and well. He hoped that what he was seeing in front of him wasn't a fake.

Years of special operation has taught him that ignoring reality was likely to lead to very bad things. People who died, should remain dead. Cromwell broke his rule. So he has to believe what what we seeing in front of his eyes.

The man who gave up his life so that Earth can survive is not dead.

Walking to the control room didn't take long for General Hammond. His office wasn't really that far away.

"Frank Cromwell, am I hearing this right? You ended up seventeen year into the future on an alternate Earth, where we are the subject of a television series?"

"Yes, I believe that's about right," Cromwell affirmed.

"The probability of encountering such a reality is incredibly low," Carter said. "To be the same in all the ways except that we are a science fiction series? It's far more likely that we would encounter a reality very similar to ours but just a tiny different. Even though that parallel realities posited by the many-world interpretation of quantum mechanics, we still have no working theories on how to actually cross one."

"And now we have verification of a working method how to cross one?" Hammond conjectured. "We already encountered alternate realities using the Reality Mirror, but that got destroyed."

"Only if we can reliably replicate the method, sir. Frank Cromwell might still be stuck on the other side if he can't dial home and return. We only have less than thirty-eight minutes before the gate shut down."

Hammond gritted his teeth. "If it come to the worst case scenario, Cromwell will be considered missing-in-action rather than dead."

A man came into the screen.

"I am a billionaire. I can arrange something for him for his stay on my Earth," an unidentified tall man spoken from the MALP. "Permanently if necessary."

"Thank you, but forgive me if I don't take your words for it," Hammond replied. He looked over to the rest of the team. "We'll assume for now that he can't reconnect with us and that there is no way to get him back. You have whatever time is left to chuck whatever you think is useful for him through the gate. Make it quick."

"Yes, sir," SG-1 replied with a grimace.

"Colonel Cromwell, if you can, please try a reconnection as soon as you can. To give you enough time, we'll try to reconnect to your address after ten minutes."

O'Neill didn't think whatever was chucked into the gate was going to help Cromwell much if any. If anything, the 'billionaire' is probably his friend's best bet.

But he wasn't about to do absolutely nothing if he could do something.

**Colonel Frank Cromwell**
**Hawthorne, Infopunk-Earth**

There was no way for Cromwell to walk back home without first reconnecting from his side of the gate and he was warned that a reconnection might not work, with the strong probability of forever being stranded here. So, the SGC did the only thing they could do. They begun chucking survival kits, MREs, and weapons.

"What we do now?" Swift asked.

"I'll get the stuff sorted, but I want to be ready to reconnect as soon as possible."

"You want to go home. I'll make sure that you go home."

"Thanks."

"But first, I want you to have my laptop."

"I am sorry?"

"If your reality is anything like the stargate series, you guys have a tough road ahead. I can at least spare you a macbook."

It wasn't long before Cromwell held a laptop in his hand. Stuff were still being chucked, but that wasn't important. If he was truly stuck in this place, he could organize it later. If not, then somebody will have to haul the items back to base.

The gate shut down unceremoniously , only for the gate to start rotating again.

"Please step back far away from the hazard line, Colonel," Swift said. Cromwell compiled. Better to have extra margin then to die.

The gate connected. It worked! He could finally go home!

"Ready?" John Swift said via radio.

"Copy that. I am ready," Cromwell said.

"This is Cromwell. SGC, do you copy?" he radioed.

"Copy. The iris is now open. You are free to proceed," the voice on the other side said.

Cromwell walked into the gate, instantaneously emerging on the other side. For a brief moment, he felt an euphoria that he was home.

A person in an orange hazmat suit made their appearance after a blast door opened.

"Follow me," a female voice ordered.

He complied.

The airman entered a quarantine room, an artifact of the visit to the land of light. That mission got the entire SGC on lockdown, forcing new security and medical procedure to be added
to prevent such recurrence.

"It's very good to see you alive," Fraiser said, before handing him a hospital gown.

"I can say the same for you, doctor," Cromwell replied as Fraiser put her hands on the back of the neck, checking for opportunistic infection by a Goa'uld parasite.

"Take a shower. After that, we're going to do a lot of medical tests to verify that you are who you are and to make sure that you're healthy. That's going to take a long time."

"Yes ma'am."

***
**September 17, 1998**

There was a lot of poking and prodding by the medical staff. Then Cromwell endured a full twenty-four hour quarantine. Debriefing was done remotely, via the intercom, but that didn't last long. Thankfully, there were entertainment options to keep the boredom at bay. At time he would watch television, or read books.

Finally, he was let go.

It had been weeks for Stargate personnels, but not for him. He was only been out of the complex for a few hours at most, returning as soon as possible.

There wasn't much to miss.

His stomach beckoned the call for lunch, and it was only hours until the scheduled meeting with General Hammond and SG-1.

He rode the elevator to the cafeteria.

On the left on his entrance was O'Neill's team. Colonel O'Neill's face brighten up.

"Look who's back?" O'Neill announced loudly, getting everyone's attention. "Cromwell is alive and well! Three cheers and a toast!"

Cromwell smiled slightly. It leave no doubt that the SGC is a true community that cared for one another, even if Cromwell didn't feel the same way about himself. He was glad that he was alive, but from their perspective, he was supposed to be dead. They had conducted his funeral not too long ago.

***

The SGC dealt with galactic affair, away from the ire of the public yet Lieutenant Major General George Hammond's office was as ordinary as it could get. There's no visible alien tech inside this office just yet. However, Cromwell knew that this command was only two years old, not a lot of time to develop technology.

There's also an extra person in this room beside Hammond and himself, a man named Irvine Fletcher, the SGC's counsel. A mostly bald man in his fifty, this man mostly melted in the background, checking over everything from agreement with aliens to NDA made with individuals outside the SGC.

"Have a seat, Colonel," Hammond said. Already, he could see the weary look on Hammond's face. "What am I going to do with you? Through no fault of your own, you came back from the dead."

Fletcher nodded and adjusted his glasses. "Our assumption is that you died in the black hole. Accordingly, a death certificate was issued, assets were transferred to an estate, and your will is taken care of. You no longer have a penny to your name and you don't exist in the eyes of the court."

Cromwell nearly choked on that. Everything he earned for his entire life is simply gone, because everyone assume that no one can survive being sucked in by a black hole. According to Carter, there's no reason to expect that the black hole would transport him to an alternate reality, let alone a reality that considered this reality part of a fictional universe.

"So this is going to be a problem," Cromwell replied.

"It is," Hammond said. "Aside from the legal aspect, it also plays hell with keeping a program secret. You are a Colonel. You had been in contact with innumerable people, many of which has came to your funeral. They're going to ask a question, 'why are you alive?'. We're going to have to craft a very convincing story as to why. That would be a lot easier if we were officially at war with someone else on this planet. Thankfully, we are not."

"So, I am not going back to my old life."

"I didn't say that we are going to just throw up our hands up and do nothing."

"The general spoken to the president about this, and the president are willing to provide you lawyers to help get back your legal identity," Fletcher said. "Of course, there's a balancing act to keep the program secret."

"During that time, I am stuck in a limbo?"

"That is correct," Fletcher admitted. "You are also not under contract nor obligation to serve in the United States Air Force. If you decided not to work for the SGC or the air force, the SGC is willing to provide cost-of-living stipend plus pension and a temporary identity so that you can find wo-."

"I am not going to do that," Cromwell said. "From my perspective, I had only left the SGC hours at most."

"You will also acquire a temporary identity if you decide to work here, but you will be paid O-6 and the years you served accordingly," Fletcher continued where he left off. The colonel knew that he will earned more than most Americans, but it still stung to lose everything he had worked for.

"For the sake of secrecy, you will not contact anybody or anyone outside of the SGC community," Hammond added. "This is temporary until we have a cover story for you."

Fletcher handed Cromwell a NDA(non-disclosure agreement). "You will need to sign this. For now, you are not considered a member of the military. I am working to change this as soon as possible."

While most people would sign right away, the colonel read over it. He knew that it was a standard agreement handed out to civilians.

***

The news coming from Hammond and Fletcher was bad and unexpected, but Frank Cromwell wasn't the kind of man to dwell in misery. As far as he was concerned, the command had taken care of his short term needs and saw fit to give him back his salary. He may not be retiring any time soon, but the airman has it in his mind to keep going as long as possible. He couldn't scarcely imagine what he will do as a retired man. Teach military history?

Still, there was one thing lingering in the back of his mind. His relation with an estranged friend and colleague, O'Neill. The legendary leader of SG-1 has showed every indication of having changed his mind, no longer showing sourness or throwing barbs his way. Still, in Cromwell's mind, it remained unresolved.

Cromwell approached O'Neill in a hallway.

"Can I talk with you for a second" Cromwell asked.

"Sure," O'Neill replied, before detouring to an unoccupied room.

"About the war in Iraq..."

"Whatever happened there, I sort of got over it."

"Because I saved the world and sacrifice myself?"

"Yeah," O'Neill admitted, nodding. "I don't know if I believe or forgive you. Maybe I couldn't. Regardless, I ended up in that Iraqi prison. That was personal hell. There's nothing that you experienced could ever possibly come close to this, except this."

O'Neill gestured a gun to the side of his head. "I closed my eyes in preparation for my final moment. Then there was a click. Nothing happened. It was a mock execution, but it was torture all the same. Maybe it would be better if you shoot me rather than just leaving me for dead."

"I don't think I am that sort of that person."

"I think we are capable of anything given the right impetus. If I am getting tortured all over again, will you kill me?"

"I rather not find out."

"That's a shame, but I still believe that you will do it."

"If I want to change something in the past, it would not be to shoot you but to drag your ass to the helicopter."

"I know you would."

"So am I forgiven?"

O'Neill paused, before looking straight into Cromwell's eyes. "Yeah," he said. "We're good."

***

Members from SG-1 was arrayed on one side of the conference table. General Hammond sat in the middle. Cromwell sat across from SG-1.

"First of all, I am happy to announce that we are able to repeatedly reconnect with the alternate Earth," Hammond said. "All telemetry is nominal and that there is no indication that this alternate Earth will get sucked in by a black hole any time soon." There were a few chuckles at that. "Carter and her team still don't know how long-term this connection is, but I hoped that it will be permanent."

Cromwell smiled at that news. Combining two populations in the fight against the Goa'uld would be welcome news. Of course, there was a possibility that this alternate Earth might be hostile or a threat, but that was rated very low.

Hammond turned his eyes toward Carter. "Can you elaborate further on this connection?"

"As the general said earlier, the physics department still do not understand the underlying physics of the connection established between ours and their," Doctor Carter confirmed. "We also established that their Earth should be located about roughly where we are, astronomically speaking. Their night sky are the same as ours, seventeen years in advance. This suggested strongly that they are in fact in an alternate universe, but that's not the only possibility."

"What do you mean by 'only possibility'?" Colonel O'Neill asked.

"In an infinite universe, every iteration and configuration of Earth should come up at least once," Carter answered. "Rather than existing in an alternate dimension, they might simply exist very far away from here. Regardless, we don't know how to yet distinguish one reality from another or if the universe is infinite."

"So, for now, the science is unsettled," Hammond concluded.

"Yes, that's one way to put it," Carter affirmed.

"Next's on the agenda is the television series we received when Cromwell crossed back," Hammond announced. "O'Neill?"

"It was very difficult to watch for some members of my team to watch, sir. The inaccuracy were a distraction." O'Neill appraised. "After a few episodes I realized the potential disaster it might bring to SG-1 and the rest of command, so I ordered everyone to stop watching it.."

"Why?" Cromwell questioned.

"Because it contained information about the future that might be inaccurate," O'Neill said. "How are we supposed to use something that can be misleading as well a lifesaver? The episodes contradicted our knowledge of how the past went, how we operate, what weapons we used. It's unreliable."

"Nonetheless, the mistake can't be undone," Hammond said. "We'll have to move on to make use of or neutralize dangerous information. I want every piece of the franchise analyzed to the last scrap for any useful intelligence. It will be analyzed independently by separate teams not from SGC so that their conclusion will not be contaminated. Is there any objections or concerns?"

"How fast could we get it done?" Cromwell asked.

"It will be a priority project, and it will be done as soon as possible. I am assuming that we will extract the intel from the laptop for use by multiple teams. If we can get Mr. Swift's cooperation, I am sure we will receive more videos from their franchise."

**Captain Samantha Carter**

Captain Samantha Carter was somewhat computer literate, enough to operate safely on her own without immediately panicking. However, computing and tech support wasn't what she did for a living. That duty belonged to Chief Master Sergeant Harriman. The laptop of the future were in front of them, and he was the one operating the device, but even he has a slightly difficult time getting to where he needs to go.

"Where do I go right now?" Harriman said, speaking to a face on the screen.

"You'll want to register an account at gmail dot com," Swift, the billionaire said. "That will be your email account."

"Got it."

Carter sat through it, proactively asking questions along the way, and taking part getting used to this futuristic device with its blazing fast gigabit connection delivered wirelessly through the gate. It was certainly a far cry from her dialup connection that she was used to.

Finally, Harriman was gone. She was all alone, with Swift still reachable if she need to ask an question.

She started typing an email to a professor that she knew.

A thought occurred to her? Physics might be different on their Earth. No, if that was true, why was the computer in front of her still working, downloading and transmitting information. For that matter, where did the gate came from?

No. That wasn't relevant to what she need to do. She put those thought aside, and set to work.
