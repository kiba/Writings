Given that I seemed to be on the cusp of finishing a fanfic(however poorly written) project of mine, I given permission to myself to start a new project, this time a worldbuilding project for 'Gaia', which is an idea I played around in one form or another.

The premises is this:

Gaia is essentially a re-mixed version of Earth, with different nations and timeline, and yet resonate with us due to similar theme and historical progression.

It does not mean for example, that there is a UK, or Greece, or Japan, though there would be analogies. I intended to make significiant use of Earth history(thus requiring historical research) to craft Gaia's own.

I do plan to set at least one well-defined story in this universe, but it will be helped if I actually do enough worldbuilding beforehand.

Anyway, let us go...start a world(or restart).

"It is to my horror and consternation that I must announce to you that the madness of war once again reached us. Many of you had thought that the last war would be the last one, a war to end all other war. Now we all  we must prepare this nation again to fight for its very survival. The dream of peace for all people depends on it!" Empress
