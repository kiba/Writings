# **Chapter 17: First Contact**

**Headmaster Ozpin**
**Vale Police Department Headquarter**

Professor Ozpin found himself in a police station next to a scroll-like electronic surrounded by technicians and policemen, just waiting for him to reply to a woman's voice. Earlier, there was an insistent demand by the voice from the scroll to the lab technicians to talk to whoever's in charge. That initially went to the lab technicians' boss, then to the head of the police department, and finally to Ozpin himself in rapid succession. If it was first contact however, then it would likely to escalate to the ruling council themselves. For now, he will be doing the talking.

"To who am I speaking to?" Ozpin asked.

"Doctor Yure Shinatose," the scroll answered. "Of the starship Sidonia. I am a healer. I believed you have in custody of our two explorers in your hospital."

"Aliens? From space?"

"In a way, but we're also humans. Yes, my people live in space."

There were the incredulous stares, but also slack-jawed faces as well. Some were just confused. Meeting aliens from another world was a common staple of science fiction for the last hundred of years or so, but to actually be meeting them?

There was however, one question that he have to ask.

"You're not planning to invade us, are you?"

"We have no plans, but our explorers are grave in danger of dying. We know it from the transponders you removed. Your doctors do not understand our physiology. So, I would greatly appreciate it if you arrange a visit. We'll come here by foot."

"Ah." He nodded to the police chief to get ready to make plans. "We will make such a visit possible as soon as we can."

Just like that, he made a decision that will soon be irrevocable. He's going to need a lot of huntsmen for security.

**Yure Shinatose**

There was something of an exhilaration of being able to actually walk under a blue sky cloudy sky, where the weather wasn't scheduled at all, and that the world wasn't limited to just the arkship that she lived in.

The forest was also something new entirely.

She can feel the dirt underneath her boots, while taking in the aroma of the pinetrees surrounding her her. Granted, she was briefly on Earth, but she never saw the skies or the surrounding outside the warehouse.

Eventually, she saw a couple of aircrafts in the air.

"I saw what looked like aircrafts," she spoke into her phone.

"Good, that mean those bullheads are in the right region," professor Ozpin said.

Shinatose fired her flare into the air, signaling that she was there.

One of them came in for the landing, pivoting its engine so it can land vertically. Air swiverl more violently as it touched down. A door slid open.

"Doctor Yure Shinatose?" a man asked.

"Yes, that's me."

"OK, you two, get on board."

Shinatose and her guard, Mayumi Yoshizawa boarded the bullhead.

It wasn't very long until Shinatose saw the roof of one of their hospital and the crowd that surrounded the building, neatly separated by security to allow ambulance and people to enter the hospital.

Flashes of light from photographers inundated the rooftop as the bullhead came in for the landing.

"Here we go," a man next to her said, wearing a large sword on his back. "I'll be escorting you." Her escort reminded her of fantasy novels she read a lifetime ago, but she didn't comment on her disbelief.

Finally, she was escorted to a meeting room with a tired and weary man and an older man with a coffee mug.

She bowed nervously, as did her guard. "I am Yure Shinatose," she introduced herself. "And this is my guard and assistant, Mayumi Yoshizawa."

"I am professor Ozpin, headmaster of the Beacon Academy," the older-looking man said. "And Doctor Ross Steff is in charge of your relatives' care."

"Actually, they are not my relatives," she corrected. "Crewmembers yes, and our society always strive to take care of their being, no matter who they are. " She turned her head to the doctor. "Now doctor, about my patients..."
