# **Chapter 17: First Contact**

**Headmaster Ozpin**
**Vale Police Department Headquarter**

Professor Ozpin found himself in a police station next to a scroll-like electronic surrounded by technicians and policemen, just waiting for him to reply to a woman's voice. Earlier, there was an insistent demand by the voice from the scroll to the lab technicians to talk to whoever's in charge. That initially went to the lab technicians' boss, then to the head of the police department, and finally to Ozpin himself in rapid succession. If it was first contact however, then it would likely to escalate to the ruling council themselves. For now, he will be doing the talking.

"To who am I speaking to?" Ozpin asked.

"Doctor Yure Shinatose," the scroll answered. "Of the starship Sidonia. I am a healer. I believed you have in custody of our two explorers in your hospital."
