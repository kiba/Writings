# **Chapter 2: Survival Failure**

There was a fucking planet in the sky!

That thought kept repeating itself for several times until I shook myself. If this was Earth, then it wasn't any Earth that I knew.

My stomach growled, reminding me that my personal survival was at stake. The gigantic sphere was almost quite irrelevant if there wasn't any civilization nearby.

Hopefully, I am still on Earth and that this reality is simply a variation of home.

I sighed, continuing onward with my task of marking trees as waypoints. However, I got sloppier and lazier as I go, to the point that it was simply a straight line. Then I started skipping trees.

It can't be that bad if I mark trees further, right?

My marking degenerated even further. Neatness was of zero concern. Each time I marked a tree, it took away times away from other activities. Suddenly, it became clear that my idea wasn't a good idea at all. But how was I am supposed to navigate in this god forsaken forest?

Those degeneration and shortcuts mirrored my mounting desperation. I was hungry as hell, especially since I dumped the content of my stomach. I couldn't hunt, and everything was unfamiliar to me.

Every mushroom a potential food source, but also a danger. I could get hallucination, or die of food poisoning.

Small animals? Just forget it! I don't know how to hunts or make bows, my mechanical ability notwithstanding.

My eyes started sagging as the bright day began to turn into twilight, with the sun dipping into the horizon. It seemed that I wouldn't be able to find...civilization in time.

I sat down.

Just a little nap.

Then I'll go.

A red roving eye rolled left and right on a metallic face as its hand moved to check over the human's pulse.

Hydration fluid slowly flowed into the patient. There was even beeping sounds from a machine nearby, giving instrumentation to the patient's vital sign. But the display was largely unnecessary. The machine can receive all vital statistics wirelessly, the display being there only for backup.

The machine, satisfied that the patient was looking nominal, exited the cabin. Two machines guarded the cabin with a shotgun and a rifle.

The machine turned to the guards. It stood very still. From the outside, there appeared to be nothing, no spontaneous movement or attempt at communication. But they were entirely busy via radio, communicating in short bursts at blinding speeds. The exchange of information on the patient was done in milliseconds, but other questions about the lost patient arise that required simulations and decision tree branching.

Every plausible decision regarding the patient was mapped out, including implausible scenarios. When they were done, they mapped out ten thousand five hundred thirty one. Undoubtedly, they could get more on the network, but communication would reveal their presence.

This was certainly no hospital. For one thing, it was a small wooden cabin surrounded by the forest, guarded by several robots, and no humans excepted the strangely attired patients. Blinking lights peaked over the horizon and in the night sky, a sign of civilization.
