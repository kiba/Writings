[I]Dear Journal,

The Cylons were mad as hell. They conspired with my girlfriend, got together, and discussed me in their new fanged Faraday cage. You know what? They were right to be angry and concerned.

But I can't help but explore the multiverse, you know?

Anyway, they put down a couple of ground rules that I didn't really like. I tried to argue that they were interfering on my birth-given right to explore. It didn't really work all that well as an argument.

Diana, as usual, knocked some sense into me. I think they also got some sort of plan to subdue me should I go crazy. I rather not learn the details.

The days of simply jumping in the unknown was over. As a result of that, Diana and I decided to focused our engineering efforts on building better ways to survey the environment.

"Looking good," I said, commenting on a recently fabricated probe with a set of quadcopter scouts. It was mostly a mishmash of Colonial and Earth technologies, along with optional Sidonian hardwares. Earthling technologies form the base of our effort, since it was the only industrial base available to us that I was allowed to trust.

We were also no longer operating out of our home. It was too small to accommodate the scale and complexity of the work we were doing. Thus, we built and designed this probe in this warehouse, our new 'business' place. In reality, the cylons were still doing all the work earning money, while we humans focused on trans-dimensional travel and technologies.

The new exploration probes were the latest fruit of our labor.

It was a way to survey the multiverse without risking human lives.

"We could add the Toha cam-" a Sidonian engineering advisor almost said.

"YES I KNOW! But I don't trust you guys, yet," I interrupted his thought process.

I was sure that they weren't going to harm me, but the Cylons disagreed. Even after a lengthy negotiation in which the Cylons somehow social kung-fu and strong-armed their captain, giving us lot of stuff and perks, they were still suspicious.

"When you will trust us? You're our ancestors."

"Trust will come, eventually. It had to be earned."

Daichi Chou was one of the few Sidonians who was sent to my reality, exchanging place every few days with Sasaki, given that she was still the head honcho of the Sidonian engineering department, thus posessing responsibility from back home. He's a really smart fellow, though he suffered from the desire to use Sidonians technologies in everything, given that it was indeed superior to Earthling tech.

That didn't mesh with well with the Cylon policy of not being too reliant on technologies they and I don't understand, not until we were able to understand and replicate their tech base, which was an annoyingly slow going process.

"I know....but.."

"It can't be helped."

I turned my head to the Cylon designed trans-dimensional machine, which I had yet to name. The cylons were all over it putting on the finishing touch.

This was the Version 2.0 Trans-dimensional Machine, or TDM for short, a second generation design based on what we learned from the machine I first built and upgrade, and the Sidonian version that was built over the machine. I gifted my old machine to the Sidonians for them to study.

Of course, they were not going to go away, still insisting to stay close to the source that made trans-dimensional travel possible. There was a number of issues preventing them from safely exploring the multiverse.

"I wish we can fit the trans-dimensional drive in a full garde," Chou said. "Or hell, Sidonia itself."

"Of course."

There was a big limitation in my technology in scaling the bubble needed to transit larger objects, plus mass limitation which put great strain on the energy needed, though the TDM was currently limited by volume more than mass.

The biggest change for version 2.0 of the TDM was that the electronics and parts for transiting between worlds finally got rationalized. There's no overly complicated parts we couldn't discern the purpose of, not the mad scientist made bespoken parts that was part of the original machine.

Other engineers can now understand and make modifications to it as needed, and we could manufacture parts easy for it.

Otherwise, version 2.0 was slightly better in many aspects in regard to transit size and mass allowance, as well less likely to induce upset stomach and nausea. That last part was important.

"The beacons are ready, sir," Chou suddenly reported.

We walked to the other end of the warehouse, until we were at corner where they manufacturing the beacons, which were little more than soccer ball shaped stuffed full of trans-dimensional electronics. Those beacons will essentially allow us to triangulate our location in space across the multiverse, allowing safer travel in the multiverse.

This led to me to a second thought.

"We could use it for FTL travel."

Chou immediately boggled at the thought. "What?"

"Simple. Once you have enough beacons, you can jump between universes without getting lost."

Chou suddenly became very alarmed. "How did we get to Sidonia?"

I nodded at that bit of insanity. "For some reason, I am the ultimate jump computer. I can jump to the Twelves Colonies of Man which was many thousand light years away from Earth, and I am capable of pin-point jump to Sidonia, since I knew its exact trajectory and position."

"But how???"

"Bullshit mind magic, that's what! Anyway, I want to know too, but we'll have to accept it for what it is. Anyway, with trans-dimensional beacons spread across the multiverse, but it'll have to be located within a few light years away. Only then could we do pin-point jump. However, an opposing force can use the trans-dimensional signals to triangulate and do just the same."

"But if the enemy can't do that, then it'll be an instantaneous win."

"Yes, but only if you have something like thousand of beacons in only a few light years. Hundred of beacons would be no problems, allowing you to explore the local multiverse without getting lost."

Of course, Colonial FTL travel required no such beacons, without the need to survey the multiverse beforehand, and without the need to somehow secure the beacons from enemy force, and it too can do instantaneous jump, but not into a gravity well.

"And of course, you could also jam trans-dimensional travel," I said, mentioning one other limitation.

Chou nodded at that. It was one of the first things the Sidonian realized in conjunction with the Cylons when they made their initial study in trans-dimensional theory.

**Captain Kobayashi**

Even after all the bitter negotiation with the Cylons, Kobayashi still found it in herself to be excited, because today was to be the demonstration of a prototype using Colonial style artificial gravity, which was very cheap compared to Sidonia's artificial gravity furnace. The side effect of the technology, anti-gravity, should allow greater performance of both Sidonia and the gardes mecha that were the mainstay defenders against the gauna.

"So, Sasaki, what do you supposed we do with the gravity furnace?" Kobayashi asked the engineer next to her. They were in the shipyard, watching a cadre of engineers working out the last minute details of the prototype test.

"I don't know. We'll probably end up scrapping it for raw materials. There's no advantages that I can find in keeping it."

"Really?"

"I would like to keep it as a museum object somewhere like they used to do on ancient Earth, just in case we really do find some other use for the furnace. But we got no space to put them."

"The design, like everything else, should be stored within the archive."

"That's true, but there's nothing like a working example in front of us to study."

Finally, an engineer reported to Sasaki about the status of the ship.

"We're about to ready to test the prototype, Captain," Sasaki said.

The prototype in question was a shuttle turned into a drone, and fitted with gravity plates. It was unknown if the heigus fields would interact negatively with Colonial artificial gravity technology, so the plan was to send the ship away at some sufficient distance away that the Sidonian felt safe at testing.

Slowly, the shuttle was towed into position inside a large rocket launch platform. Then the rocket was lift by elevator into the outside world.

"All clear. Ready to launch," a voice said over the public address system. The rocket and the shuttle's telemetry showed up on a large flat screen nearby as the launch conductor went through a checklist and then a countdown.

At least, the rocket was launched into deep space.

"And we're done for now," Sasaki spoke up. "We'll know the result when the shuttle activate and send back videos."

Kobayashi nodded. "I'll leave you to your duties."

I thought that the surveying tech will be ready many time this month, but usually there's always problem that pop up. 'Today's finally the day' I would say, only to be proven wrong in the next few hours or so.

But is there any complex engineering projects that ever kept to a schedule?

"So, today's finally the day?" I said to no one in particular as I sipped some coffee. If there's one thing that didn't change in a particular grimdark future, and that's coffee. I was drinking a particular unique blend of coffee I brought from their ship.

Skipping the other areas, I made my way to the control room, which was stuffed full of Earthling computers, with custom softwares coded by Cylons and staffed by engineers from two other verses.

"Ah, you finally arrived," Delta said. "We're finally through the last bugs in the system. We should be ready to launch any seconds now."

Then the cylon handed me a tablet for me to look over last night's event logs. Research and development was occurring around the clock at breakneck speed, with a total of three shifts around the clock. With the exception of the Cylons, humans need rest to function at maximum efficiency.

Just as they were conducting a rocket launch, the control center staff began the launch sequence.

Just like a rocket launch, it was also a dramatic and emotional moment. I crossed my fingers as the countdown.

With the usual characteristic 'pew' sound, the robotic probe disappeared into thin air and into another reality, one I entered the coordinate for and which they didn't need to sedate me with tranquilizer for my sake.

The control room broke into premature applause, celebrating the fact that the transit was apparently successful. I can confirm that it was, but there's no telling that it will be able to transit back to this reality.

Right on cue, we heard the pew sound as the probe transited back to our reality after a twenty four hours period of observation. Almost immediately, there was a loud cheer for success as everyone hug and congratulate each other.

Even the cylons were showing their subdued appreciation, mostly rocking their eyes back and forth faster and putting their hands up in the air.

The probe had transited back into a cleanroom, which was immediately sterilized by radiation for good measure. No one wanted to take any chance.

Once that was done, a technician dressed in a biohazard suit came inside the cleanroom and started pulling off the hard drives.

The hard drives wasn't going to go anywhere outside the cleanroom. Instead, they were inserted into a computer that was brought in.

"We got video," the technician finally announced, leading to another round of applause.

We did it! We found another world.

"And there's local artificial radio transmission," the technician continued. "And it appeared to be in English!"

More cheering came.

Thank god I found a world that spoke our language. We don't have to struggle so much with languages now. Of course, there's lot of work to do afterward. We were not going to go this place without proper preparation.
