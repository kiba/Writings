# **Chapter Two: A Planet in the Sky**

At first, I can only see pure white, purer than anything I ever seen. Then the distortion began, twisting every part of my body and the machine, but not actually twisting. Finally, the endless white reformed into an actual image of something, a forest. It was even teaming with the scent, sound, and smell of the forest.

The whirling of the machine began to slowly die out. Until it suddenly went CLACK! One of the doodas just broke.

"Fuck," I realized. "FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!"

Then a light drizzle of rain pelted my machine. That wasn't too bad, actually. I did built some crude life support into the machine, along with protective materials and coating.

But I hate the dark cloud that the rain came from. It tended to depress me.

If the miserable weather and a malfunctioning machine wasn't enough, I was becoming more dizzy and nauseous by the second.

"Oh god," I said.

Immediately, I threw up on the spot, disgorging partly digested pizza and mountain dew next to my machine.

Luckily, I managed to slump into the ground away from the disgusting content. But it was a good while before the dizziness fade away.

When I finally stood up, I took out my phone.

But there was no signal of anything. Damn it! Not even GPS was working.
But there was no signal, damn it! Not even GPS!

Great, just great. If I were really in another reality, then I am in the middle of fucking nowhere. If I am not on Earth, then I am probably absolutely screwed, especially since there was no way I can machine parts without the necessary civilizational context that the machine was built in. And if the civilization was different altogether, then I am still screwed, just not so badly. They'll have different standard and numbers and parts machined to different specs if I am lucky to be roughly in the same technological period.

Normally, I would be leaping in joy that my mad scientist persona wasn't some delusion of mine, even though the personality had left a lot to be desired. But I am not in the mood right now, because without food and water I am going to die.

Armed with half learned wilderness survival knowledge from television shows, I paced around the forest, while keeping in my sight the machine I built, careful not to get lost. Then I laboriously marked each tree to show where I was going and then backtrack for verification so that I could venture away from machine without getting totally lost. Slow work, but the last thing I need is to get completely lost, which will mean that I will have no way of getting home.

An hour went by, and the cloud cleared, along with the rain. Since then, I discovered a nearby stream, but still no signs of civilization. The water looked crystal clear at least, though I know that I need to at least heat the water up to kill some pathogen. How am I going to do that without a metal pot?

Then, I approached an open patch of the forest.

I looked up. My jaw dropped.

There was a fucking planet in the sky. Why didn't I notice just now?

"Holy shit!" I said to no one in particular.
