# **Chapter Nineteen: Cultural Exchange**

**James Archer**
**Archer's Residence, Vale**
**July 13, 2015**

It was another morning on the planet Remnant in an oddly familiar surrounding, an apartment. There wasn't too much different from Earth. There's a restroom, bedroom, kitchen, and a dining room.

Early on, Diana, Sasaki, and I decided to pool our resources together and save as much money as possible so that we can build up personal access to resources.

So I ended up in a slightly run down apartment in a slightly run down neighborhood, currently cooking pancakes and scrambled eggs.

It was just Diana and me for breakfast, as usual. Sasaki was off sunbathing in the bathroom, doing higeus photosynthesis, though she would join us from time to time.

"You're going to visit the local television studio, right?" Diana asked.

"Of course," I responded, not knowing where she's going with this.

"Don't say anything stupid."

"Of course. Wait what?"

"I don't know, like suggesting that you don't have a soul."

"Hey, that's the truth!"

"It may be the truth, but it's incendiary, like dissing Christianity."

"Because Christianity is a bunch of hokey pokey, even Sasaki agreed."

"Don't you understand? We're public figures now. This is just different from working with a small group of people, this is you representing all of Earth."

"Babe, you don't trust me?"

"We're both outspoken sometime. Not afraid to say what's on our mind. However, that can get us in trouble."

"I am not going to lie on stage about what I believed."

"I am not asking you to do that. I just want you to be diplomatic."

After breakfast, I stepped into the street with my housemates. It was a narrow street, a reminder of an age when Vale did not have cars. Though it was not evident how crammed in the Kingdom itself was. Much of the land were devoted to agriculture, and time went on, increased efficiency allowed that sector to feed an increasingly large number of people, which then expanded into the farmland. However, much of the population growth were concentrated vertically more than horizontally, given that further cession of land would meant starvation.

"Bye!" the ladies said as they went off to a different direction, with a hidden guard following behind. I went off to another direction, accompanied by another guard.

Vale had made it clear that their most important guests and residents are 'secure'.

**Vale News Network**

Watching the news was a ritual that the people of Vale shared with the people of Earth, or Sidonia, and even the Twelves Colonies, even if global and local matters were usually not terribly important to their life.

"We have a special guest this morning," Lisa Lavender said after finishing the usual news item. "We were able to secure an exclusive interview with Vale's newest resident James Archer."

"Hello, and thank you," Archer said. "I am grateful for the people of Vale to invite me living here."

"What do you think of Vale?"

"Uh, it's a very nice city," Archer said nervously. "It's not at all too different from the city I used to live in. It got restaurants, shops, banks, and all the usual."

"What is it that the city of Vale have that your home don't have?"

"Dust shop for example. I am still learning the dust dynamics."

"I heard Earth don't have dust and yet still managed to develop a technological society at least as advanced as ours. How did you do it without dust?"

James Archer blinked. "I don't know? There was never any dust on Earth that I am aware of. So if we want technology, we have to do without it."

"That doesn't seem much of an answer."

"How am I supposed to answer? I only know the awesome wonder of dust for less than a month."

"Your world doesn't have the grimm nor the space monsters the Sidonians called the Gauna. Yet it's not totally a utopia, isn't it?"

"Sidonia is absolutely more of a utopia than either Remnant and Earth. On Earth, we have lot of issues, a lot of it of our own making. There's a whole host of prejudices that the people of Remnant would be quite horrified to learn of. We discriminated on the basis of the color of their skin, their sexuality, their religion, and even their gender."

"I don't understand."

"You guys may be scared of the Grimm, but on Earth, it is only people who can be monsters. The Sidonians said that we're in the midst of the beginning of Earth's golden age, that our troubles will begin to disappear, but I am quite frankly hoping to get it over with as soon as possible."

"It doesn't sound like a place I would want to vacation over."

Archer laughed. "I am just describing some of the problems that we have as a global civilization. Don't take that as representative of Earth. My home country is quite nice to live in with almost the same living standard as Vale. It's not surprising when the United States is a world superpower and an economic powerhouse."

The interview continued on for another thirty minutes.

**Professor Oobleck**
**Beacon Academy, Remnant**

Professor Oobleck had put a new burden on his students. Instead of lecturing on the history of Remnant, he elected to screen the Archer interview from VNN to his classes. Of course, they took up with it with great enthusiasm, though predictably, they bemoaned his tests and homework.

The room was dark, and the students were all focused on the holographic television with intense attention, hanging on to every word. They wanted to know as the professor do, to understand a world, if not his own.

Which was very interesting to him. Novelty almost certainly played a role. Remnant was the world that they knew, and Earth wasn't.

Of course, he had to turned on the light.

There was a huge groan.

"Now, now, I am sure you all wanted to hear every single word that came out of his mouth," the huntsman acknowledged. "But I am not going to let you go without any reflection on he said. We shall have a class discussion on this. "
