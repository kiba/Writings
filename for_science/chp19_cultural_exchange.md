# **Chapter Nineteen: Cultural Exchange**

**James Archer**
**Archer's Residence, Vale**
**July 13, 2015**

It was another morning on the planet Remnant in an oddly familiar surrounding, a small apartment. They weren't too much different from Earth. There's a restroom, bedroom, kitchen, and a dining room, all painted in the most bright and ugly color as possible, a holdover from the Great War. I swore that it had for a time destroyed all sense of aesthetics on Remnant.

Early on, Diana, Sasaki, and I decided to pool our resources together and save as much money as possible so that we can build up personal access to resources.

So I ended up in a slightly run down apartment in a slightly run down neighborhood, currently cooking really small portion of pancakes and scrambled eggs, because Remnan grocery was way too filling for bog standard humans.

***

It was just Diana and me for breakfast, as usual. Sasaki was off sunbathing in the bathroom, doing higeus photosynthesis. Unlike bog standard humans, she doesn't need to eat breakfast or lunch or dinner everyday. Though she usually tried to time her photosynthesis sessions so that she can sit with us for companionship.

"You're going to visit the local television studio, right?" Diana asked.

"Of course," I responded, not knowing where she's going with this.

"Don't say anything stupid."

"Of course. Wait what?"

"I don't know, like suggesting that you don't have a soul."

"Hey, that's the truth!"

"It may be the truth, but it's incendiary. It's like dissing Christianity."

"Because Christianity is a bunch of hokey pokey, even Sasaki agreed."

"Don't you understand? We're public figures now. This is just different from working with a small group of people, this is you representing all of Earth."

"Babe, you don't trust me?"

"We both can be outspoken, not afraid to say what's on our mind. However, that can get us in a lot of trouble."

"I am not going to lie on stage about what I believe."

"I am not asking you to do that. I just want you to be diplomatic."

After breakfast, I stepped into the street with my housemates. It was a narrow street, a reminder of an age when Vale did not have cars, evident how crammed in the Kingdom itself is. Much of the land were devoted to agriculture, and time went on, increased efficiency allowed that sector to feed an increasingly large number of people, which then expanded into the farmland. However, much of the population growth were concentrated vertically more than horizontally, given that further cession of land would meant starvation.

"Bye!" the ladies said as they went off to a different direction, with a hidden guard following behind. I went off to another direction, accompanied by another guard.

Vale had made it clear that their most important guests and residents are 'secure and safe'.

**Vale News Network**

Watching the news was a ritual that the people of Vale shared with the people of Earth, or Sidonia, and even the Twelves Colonies, filling a bizarre need to know about places, persons, and events that usually don't affect their lives.

"We have a special guest this morning," Lisa Lavender said after finishing the usual news item. "We were able to secure an exclusive interview with Vale's newest resident, James Archer."

"Hello, and thank you," Archer said. "I am grateful for the people of Vale to invite me living here."

"What do you think of Vale?"

"Uh, it's a very nice city," Archer said nervously. "It's not at all too different from the city I used to live in. It got restaurants, shops, banks, and all the usual."

"What is it that the city of Vale have that your home don't have?"

"Dust shop for example. I am still learning the dust dynamics."

"I heard Earth don't have dust and yet still managed to develop a technological society at least as advanced as ours. How did you do it without dust?"

James Archer blinked. "I don't know? There was never any dust on Earth that I am aware of. So if we want technology, we have to do without it."

"That doesn't seem much of an answer."

"How am I supposed to answer? I only know the awesome wonder of dust for less than a month. All my life, I was thinking how to do things without dust. Believe me, it's not terribly important if you want to make cars, computers, aircrafts, or any number of things."

"Your world doesn't have the grimm nor the space monsters the Sidonians called the Gauna. Yet it's not paradise, isn't it."

"Sidonia is absolutely more of a utopia than either Remnant and Earth. On Earth, we have lot of issues, a lot of it of our own making. For example, there's a whole host of prejudices that the people of Remnant would be quite horrified to learn of. At some point in time or another, we discriminated arbitrary on the basis of the color of their skin, their sexuality, their religion, and even their gender."

"I don't understand."

"You guys may be scared of the Grimm, but on Earth, it is only people who can be monsters. It is only people who make wars, hurt people, and so many other unnecessary things. The Sidonians said that we're in the midst of the beginning of Earth's golden age, that our troubles will begin to disappear, but I am quite frankly hoping to get it over with as soon as possible."

"It doesn't sound like a place I would want to vacation over."

Archer laughed. "I am just describing some of the problems that we have or had as a global civilization. If someone were to describe Remnant like that, nobody would want to vacation there either. Anyway, Earth is not that terrible of a place. My home country in particular is quite nice to live in with almost the same living standard as Vale. That's true for Western Europe, East Asia, even part of China."

The interview continued on for another thirty minutes.

**Professor Oobleck**
**Beacon Academy, Remnant**

Professor Oobleck had put a new burden on his students. Instead of lecturing on the history of Remnant, he elected to screen the Archer interview from VNN to his classes. Of course, they took up with it with great enthusiasm, though predictably, they bemoaned his tests and homework.

The room was dark, and the students were all focused on the holographic television with intense attention, hanging on to every word. They wanted to know as the professor do, to understand a world, if not his own.

Which was very interesting to him. Many of them wouldn't give Remnant any time of day, but Earth is a whole different matter. He suspected it was the large amount of novel information streaming from this Earth person.

Of course, at some point, he have to turn on the light.

He flicked the switch, lighting the place up. There was a huge collective groan in reaction.

"Now, now, I am sure you all wanted to hear every single word that came out of his mouth," the huntsman acknowledged. "But I am not going to let you go without any reflection or any analysis on what our interviewee provided about his planet."

The professor then scanned the students to 'volunteer'. He found a blonde student sleeping. The teacher didn't like that.

"Jaune Arc?" Oobleck shouted. "Are you wake?"

The student stirred from his sleep. "Hi...uh, yes?" the seventeen year old said nervously.

"Can you summarize his position on Faunus-human relations?"

Arc looked around the room nervously. "Ummm, there are no Faunus."

"That is a correct statement, but it is not an answer to the question."

"Uh...uh...uh..he doesn't hate them?"

"Mr. Jaune Arc, I will require a new essay at least five hundred words long on the subject of xenophobia in Earth society by next Friday."

There was an isolated burst of laughter from four other students.

"And those who laughed at Jaune will be forced to do the same assignment as him as well," Oobleck added.

Nobody else dared to laugh.

Then the fast talking professor picked out another student at random. "Weiss Schnee," he said. "Would you like to try answering the question that Jaune failed to answer to my satisfaction?"

"He said that it was not surprising at all," Schnee said. "He blamed it on basic human nature that remained the same from one reality to the next."

"That is correct!" Oobleck announced. "Somebody's been paying attention to the video. On his statement about human nature, I have the pleasure of actually talking to the man in person and through email and so I was in a position to understand his view in context." Oobleck took out his notes and leafed through them rapidly.

"For example, how many people here hate 'black' people as a group."

He could see the confused look on the huntsmen-in-training.

"Good. Because then I would be questioning your sanity or maybe that you aren't from this planet. On Earth, people actually did this. Our friend on television told us that it eventually got resolved through a hard long struggle, occurring over decades, though the problem of 'racism'. Just like the Faunus Rights Revolution never completely resolved all human-faunus relations."

There were some confused muttering.

"Don't you see the parallel?" Oobleck said. "That is our friend's view. The discrimination against Faunus? To him, it's not actually much different from 'racism', or 'sexism', or other kind of arbitrary discrimination. Our friend called it 'bigotry', a kind of intolerance against those who are different from themselves."

The bell rung, ending the class. The students rushed out, most giving little if any thought to what he had just talked about. He wondered if the lessons that he tried to tease out were properly absorbed by the students.

However, a student came up.

"Professor?" she asked.

"Yes, Miss Belladonna?"

"I was wondering..." Her eyes looked away, her bow twitching slightly. "If I could somehow talk to Mr. Archer?"

"Can I ask you why?"

"Well, I want to learn about hatred and how to fight it. He has a lot of experience, right?"

"I wouldn't go to presume a depth of experience, but Archer certainly know of it better than any of us do. But yes, if you want to talk to him, I can arrange it for you, in return for a report."

"I am in your debt. Thank you!"

She disappeared in a blur.

**Headmaster Ozpin's Office**

"Excuse me?" headmaster Ozpin said as he sipped his coffee. Bartholomew Oobleck too sipped a coffee from his thermo/weapon.

"I want to see the multiverse," Oobleck answered. "To collect the histories of the world and to understand their causes."

Ozpin sighed. "And it will not be just a few weeks, isn't it? It could be months or years. How am I going to find a hunter just as qualified as you? To impart the historical wisdom of the ages on to my students?"

"I have long been a proponent of the adage that 'to not learn from history is to repeat the mistakes of the past. Already, we learned just how inadequate Remnant historical perspectives is. War is not caused by the Grimm, Ozpin, no matter how people justify it otherwise."

"I have no doubt of that, doctor."

"Many people thought otherwise, and many people still believed that idea."

"I am not going to oppose a sabbatical or even your resignation, but could it wait until the next semester?"

Oobleck chuckled. "I don't think that will be a problem where I am hoping to go."

"Oh. Where would that be?"

"Earth."

Ozpin raised an eyebrow. "You wish to be part of the delegation to Earth? You still have classes to teach."

"I know. But you will have time to talk to wrangle...somebody else to take over my absence. It will only be a few days."

"That is...acceptable. Our students will need to learn more of this culture and society as soon as possible. A great way to do that is to have someone visit Earth personally. I'll see what I can do. However, this is only a one-time only deal. I will also expect your decision regarding a sabbatical or a resignation by the end of this semester."

"Understood."

**James Archer**

It was a late afternoon after work had 'officially' ended. Most of the researchers weren't really that dedicated, so they already left. However, a few of us had stayed behind, mostly Cylons and Sidonians, to keep working on our pet projects.

I was in a break between projects, looking out from the window across the street.

"GO HOME YOU COLLECTIVIST FREAKS!"

There were scores of people were on a street nearby holding up signs, protesting the foreigners' presence at the laboratory and the research agreement.

"WHAT DO WE WANT? NO IMMIGRATION FROM SIDONIA!"

They didn't like the masked Captain, and they didn't particularly like the homogeneity that characterized Sidonia, nor the Sidonians' characterization of themselves.

It didn't help that the Great War had polarized the political opinion of Remnant. That war was a near disaster implementation of a particularly extreme utopian ideology, like communism but worse. A certain political fraction on Remnant across kingdoms wanted to deafen the emotion of man to reduce the risk of Grimm invasion. Predictably, it turned out that people were very opposed to that idea.

"THEY ALL WORE THE SAME CLOTHES!"

The winners emerged from the war with a political philosophy opposite the utopian ideology, with emphasis on individuality, creativity, freedom, and the right of men.

That all sounded good, especially when I was raised on the same ideals, but my country would sound positively collectivist to them.

Those protestors outside? They were the hardcore nutcases, sprouting platitude about individuality and creativity, dressing themselves in garnish colors. Worse, they seemed to be getting bigger and bigger everyday.

I know that they aren't representative of the entire population, but they're sure not making it easy for me.

My scroll rung, showing a picture of a historian from the nearby university.

"This is James Archer," I said. "What can I do for you, professor?"

"Doctor, not professor."

"Sorry. Is this about another interview?"

"Well, no, but I am preparing to be part of the first contact delegation."

"Oh."

"So it would be helpful to learn from someone who know the customs of your country and your world."

"I don't know anything about the world. I mean, Diana and I traveled the world, but we're no experts. Especially when our world is more diverse than all of Remnant combined."

"You two are the only people of Earth that I have any access to."

"I guess...you're right."

"Would you care for us to meet tonight or some other time?"

"Sure, I can do it tonight. At what place?"

Then the doctor sent me the address for the place. "I frequented that place constantly," the doctor recommended. "It had particularly good coffee"

"Mkay. I'll bring my girlfriend if I can."

"One more thing, there's a student of mine that want to meet you. Her name is Blake Belladonna. She wanted to learn about the history of world, particularly interested in the right revolutions on Earth."

"OK, I can do that too," I thoughtlessly answered.
