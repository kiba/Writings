# **Chapter Sixteen: The Butterfly Effect**

**Professor Glynda Goodwitch**

The ambulances blared as it raced through the street of Vale, switching red light to green, shooing cars and other vehicles to the sideway.

Goodwitch was in one of those ambulance, alternating between feeling of fury and anxiety. Worried about the two bystanders who got caught in the crossfire, and angry about a very public robbery, conducted in full view of everyone.

Sooner or later, somebody will get hurt, and somebody did, with life threatening injuries.

At last, the ambulance slowed down, and then finally stopping at the entrance to a hospital. The door opened, and the huntress got out of the way before the victim was ferried out by the paramedic.

Across a few meters, she saw a distraught huntress, the young lady who decided not too long ago to engage in combat, and what a mess it was.

The huntress walked up to the student and asked, "what's your name?"

"Ruby Rose, Signal Academy, second year," the teenager replied factually.

"The situation that you were involved in is not your fault. I expected the criminals will be charged with murder. However, the police will want to take your statement before you go, and after that, we'll discuss why you escalated the situation that you did."

The girl nodded.

Sure enough, a police car arrived.

**Headmaster Ozpin**
**June 6, 2015, 1 AM**
**Vale General Hospital, Vale**

Headmaster Ozpin of the Beacon Academy had debriefed everyone, from police detective, to Professor Goodwitch, and to the little girl, Ruby Rose, spending hours into the night getting answers on the situation, even inviting the redhead to Beacon Academy.

He came to a simple, if obvious conclusion. Something went horribly wrong in the robbery. The thief Roman Torchwick and his henchman are now wanted for murder for having caused such a situation in the first place. More importantly, there were two unidentified civilians who were still in the intensive care unit, the bullets hing wrecked mayhem with their bodies.

Ozpin was looking at the surveillance footage of the incident just before the civilians got shot. They were saying something in a language that nobody could understand. It wasn't certainly any of the four kingdoms and the various dialects.

How odd. He already sent an email to the detectives about this.

"You called for me?" a deep voice said.

"Doctor Ross Steff?"

"Yes, that's me. And you must be headmaster Ozpin," the doctor in whitecoat said while extending his hand.

"Yes, that's correct. I was wondering about the unidentified civilians' health."

"Very problematic, in all sort of ways," the doctor said with a weary tone. "We got a medical mystery on our hand. No matter what we do, we are ending up in medical emergencies. There's something abnormal about their biology and I am still waiting for genetic screening and biopsies."

Ozpin sipped a cup of coffee as he contemplated the deepening mystery. "I see. I was hoping that we could question them, but that appeared not to be the case?"

"They're in a coma. I still haven't been told who they are. It would be great help if we get their medical history. We're sequencing their DNA both for diagnosis purposes and to get a match-up."

"That is a problem. Our mysterious patients had no identifying information between the two of them. Their next of kins should be contacted soon, but there's no way to do that."

The doctor's scroll began beeping loudly. "Sorry, need to go!"

"The case's getting curiouser and curiouser," Ozpin said to nobody in particular. Normally, this case wouldn't be in his purview, but since a hunter got involved and the robbery was escalated to a far more serious matter, Ozpin found himself working an actual mystery.

Ozpin opened up his scroll and dialed the detectives on the case.
