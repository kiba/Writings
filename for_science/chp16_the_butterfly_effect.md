# **Chapter Sixteen: The Butterfly Effect**

***
**Professor Glynda Goodwitch**

The ambulances blared as it raced through the street of Vale, switching traffic lights from red to greens, shooing vehicular traffics to the sideway.

Goodwitch was in one of those ambulance, alternating between feeling of fury and anxiety. Worried about the two bystanders who got caught in the crossfire, and angry about a very public and dangerous robbery.

Sooner or later, somebody will get hurt and someone just did.

At last, the ambulance slowed down before parking itself next to one of the entrance to a hospital. The door opened, and the huntress got out of the way before the victim was ferried out by the paramedic.

Across a few meters, she saw a distraught huntress, the young lady who decided not too long ago to engage in combat, and what a mess it was.

The huntress walked up to the student and asked, "what's your name?"

"Ruby Rose, Signal Academy, second year," the teenager replied factually.

"The situation that you were just involved in is not your fault. I expected the criminals will be charged with murder. However, the police will want to take your statement before you go, and after that, we'll discuss why you escalated the situation that you did."

The girl nodded.

Sure enough, a police car arrived.

**Headmaster Ozpin**
**June 7, 2015, 1 AM**
**Vale General Hospital, Vale**

Headmaster Ozpin of the Beacon Academy had debriefed everyone, from police detective, to Professor Goodwitch, and to the little girl, Ruby Rose, spending hours into the night getting answers on the situation, and even inviting the student to Beacon Academy.

He came to a simple, if obvious conclusion. Something went horribly wrong in the robbery. The thief Roman Torchwick and his henchman are now wanted for attempted murder, regardless of their intent. They were responsible for the whole situation. More importantly, there were two unidentified civilians who were still in the intensive care unit, the bullets having wrecked mayhem with their bodies.

Ozpin was looking at the surveillance footage of the incident just before the civilians got shot. They were saying something in a language that nobody could understand. It wasn't certainly any of the four kingdoms and the various dialects.

How odd. He already sent an email to the detectives about this.

"You called for me?" a deep voice said.

"Doctor Ross Steff?"

"Yes, that's me. And you must be headmaster Ozpin," the doctor in whitecoat said while extending his hand.

"Yes, that's correct. I was wondering about the unidentified civilians' health."

"Troublesome," the doctor said with a weary tone. "We got a medical mystery on our hand. No matter what we do, we are ending up in all too frequent medical emergencies. There's something abnormal about their biology and I am still waiting for genetic screening and biopsies."

Ozpin sipped a cup of coffee as he contemplated the deepening mystery. "I see. I was hoping that we could question them, but that appeared not to be the case?"

"They're in a coma. I still haven't been told who they are. It would be great help if we get their medical history. We're sequencing their DNA both for diagnosis purposes and to get a match-up in our patient database."

"That is a problem on our end as well. Our mysterious patients had no identifying information between the two of them. We want to contact their next of kins before disclosing their identity to the public, but that's simply not possible. The detectives and I are trying to get a handle on their identities as best as they could."

The doctor's scroll began beeping loudly. "Sorry, need to go!"

"The case's getting curiouser and curiouser," Ozpin said to nobody in particular. Normally, this case wouldn't be in his purview, but since a hunter got involved and the robbery was escalated to a far more serious matter, Ozpin found himself working an actual mystery.

Ozpin opened up his scroll and dialed the detectives on the case. They need to know about this.

**Detective Gole Bana**

It was the middle of the night, and detective Gole Bana was absolutely dead tired. Some assholes decided that robbery was a really good idea and ended up harming bystanders, and nobody was able to identify the injured and their pre-existing medical condition.

"Good evening," Bana said to the receptionist, before showing his badge. Then, he showed two pictures of the victims. "Have you seen these two? I know that they come and go out of this establishment."

"Let me check," the receptionist said. "Yes. They're listed under two unusual names, Keiko Haru, and Akeno Yamato. Are they in trouble?"

"Unfortunately, they are not. It would had made my life easier if they weren't. However, they are gravely injured and the doctors don't know who they are. I was hoping to get access to their room to search for their identity and medical documentation."

"That cannot be granted, sir. My boss disallowed any and all searches without a warrant."

Bana grimaced at the restriction. There was a reason why Max Blueberry was at the courthouse securing a warrant from a rudely awakened judge and not here.

"Ma'am, this is an emergency. I have two victims who are about to die. The law said that I am permitted to search a room as long as I am also in the process of securing a warrant as fast as possible. Trust me, it will be on my head."

The receptionist shifted her eyes left to right, not sure what to do.

"Alright, but it will be on your head."

"I am glad you understand."

***

"Absolutely looking normal," detective Bana said, almost though he was expecting something else. A motel crime scene was a fairly common event in his career, but there was no reason to expect something like that.

He began by going through a shopping bag, finding nothing but books on many different topics. He knew that they actually went to stores where the goods had been brought, so it wasn't a surprise.

But he immediately knew he began off on the wrong foot. Those shopping bags were unlikely to contain valuable information on the victims.

Then he found a bookbag. The blonde knew he just hit the jackpot.

He went through the small pockets, finding survival knifes and other goods belonging to an unknown brand, "Toha Heavy Industries." He never heard of it, so he noted it down in his notepad.

Then he took out a thin slab of aluminum metal.

"Huh, this looked like a notebook." Once again, it belonged to the same brand as the other goods.

Finally, he found a scroll lookalike.

"Huh? What a weird model. How do you turn it on?" he asked himself. The detective tried all sort of buttons, before finally switching the screen on.

It wasn't the familiar holographic translucent display that he seen in a typical scroll, and nor was it collapsable. There was the same logo that was found on every other objects.

Then strange unfamiliar characters began showing up.

"What language is this?"

***

"And that was that," Bana said. "There's nothing about Toha Heavy Industries nor the names. Accessing the electronics proved impossible because of security measures that were implemented."

"How curious," the headmaster replied. "One of the public CCTV captured the audio and they spoken a language I never heard of. Coupled with technological devices that clearly worked on principles different than our, then you might said that they come from a different kingdom."

"But where?"

"I don't know. We haven't explored all of Remnant just yet."

"So you expect me that they walked from another kingdom, crossing our border unnoticed, and managing to blend in without anyone noticing?"

"That does seem to be a questionable hypothesis."

"If they came from another unknown kingdom on this continent, not assuming that they use airships, then they would have encountered villages along the way, learn their customs, and blend in much better when they were finally at the border, pretending to be refugees."

"Well, then, do you have other hypothesis of your own?"

"Ugh. I don't."

"Do you have other leads you could pursue?"

"The crime lab's going through all the video footage from public CCTV and private sources as well. They went around a lot, looking at different things, so there's lot of people to see. However, I don't expect to turn up anything worthwhile."

"I see..."

"How's the victims?"

"They're still in critical condition, stabilized for now. But the doctors are very worried. They don't know what's going on with their test results. If you can't find any useful information, their last hope is DNA matches."

"Somehow, I doubt they will find a match."

**James Archer**

A probe failed to return from outside the border of Vale, signified by the absence of the probe in their chamber.

"This is...problematic," I said. "I thought there was little to nothing out there?"

"No. There shouldn't be," said my engineering advisor Daichi Chou.

"You think the locals somehow got their hands on ours?"

"That is a possibility."

"We done it several inside their city, where there should be higher probability of encounter. Now we send one probe, it's off to nowhere."

"Are we going to send more?

"No, not at this time. I am not going to risk more destroyed or cranking up the locals' suspicion. We got to prepare the probe for a safety check. Do a brief check and collect data from the environment, and then send the probe back."

The probe did make it back safely an hour after it was sent, but the safety check failed to pass, which caused a huge stir-up, and then an eventual meeting.

***

I found myself in a meeting with Ichiro Seii, the former assistant commander, now the Colonel in charge of the Trans-Dimensional Travel special project, along with Sasaki, Delta, and Diana.

The room was rather small, sectioned off from the rest of the warehouse, and only contained the simplest of things. The engineers usually do their meeting mob-styles, but this was not an engineering meeting.

"Safety check of the two operators in the city of Vale came back negative," I said, starting off the meeting. "They were to supposed to affirm their safety by checking in with any of the Sidonian electronics that they brought with them, at least once every twenty four hours.

We also received telemetry from the hidden transponders inside their bodies, but the medical doctors told me that the reports are not looking good."

"We're looking at life threatening injuries," Seii said. "That mean we might have to send a doctor."

"You're already considering sending someone so early?" Sasaki asked.

"If they are not already compromised, they are now," Seii said. "So we'll also send in an emissary along with a doctor. It's the only way if they're lying in the local's hospitals."

"Then we might be able to locate which hospital based on news from the radio."

Then Colonel Seii looked at me. "Do it."

I wasn't in the least an expert on anthropology, but I was nominally in charge of the civilians.

So I told my team Seii's order and tell them to "do it".

**Headmaster Ozpin**

After last night's event, Headmaster Ozpin finally returned to his clockwork themed office. He turned on the computer and worked through his email.

When morning came, the almost-deadly robbery made the local news, and then international news. Ozpin already ordered a team of huntsmen to search and apprehend Roman Torchwick and his accomplices, who made himself a bigger target given what just happened last night.

News about the victims continued to get stranger and stranger. A kind of transponder of an unknown design were found by surgeons, and DNA testing not only found nobody in the database in any of the kingdoms, but also suggested they were too distant to be related to anybody.

How was he supposed to make head or tail of this. He was absolutely stumped.

The door slid open, revealing Glynda Goodwitch.

"Good morning," he said.

"Good morning to you as well. I brought you your coffee."

"Thank you." Ozpin grabbed the coffee that was just recently placed on his desk. He sipped a small amount.

"Speaking of last night, how was everything?"

The headmaster sighed. "How should I say this? I made more mistakes than any man, woman, and child on this planet, and yet there are still places, people, and things that I haven't seen just yet. As an example, a patrol last night recovered a mysterious technological object located in Forever Fall. Unfortunately, the Grimm ripped the object to pieces, so we'll have to make do with analysis of bit and pieces that we were able to recover. Yet, I also felt that they're somehow related to our victims from last night."

Goodwitch raised her eyebrow.

"They were using mysterious technological artifacts as well," Ozpin clarified. "It might be hard to believe, but I do believe we have visitors not from any of the four kingdoms nor the towns and villages located outside."
