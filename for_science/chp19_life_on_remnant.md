Did I have to mention how awkward it is to wake up staring at your friend's bosom, sandwiched between two women?

I didn't know how this happened, but there was a certain natural growth in my relationship with Sasaki, and now she was sleeping in my bed, with my girlfriend's permission. I wormed my way out of my bed and to the restroom. How did it happen? When we were looking for an apartment, we looked for the cheap places to save more of our lien. Sasaki suggested pooling resource together to save even more money, and Diana accepted.

I am not about to become a harem protagonist, and no women are going to suddenly like me out of the blue, and my life wasn't an adventure. It was safe and boring. Safe and boring is good.

After my morning hygiene routine ended, I went to the next room into the living room and into the kitchen and started pulling out grocery from the fridge and the pantry.

The grocery was simply just too different than Earth's. There were similar food items but the food just tasted different. It doesn't matter what you eat or try. They were still delicious, but it took time to adjust.

I began working on pancakes and scrambled eggs, working through the motion that I perfected back on Earth, with some adjustment of course.

It was just Diana and me for breakfast, as usual. Sasaki was off sunbathing in the bathroom, doing higeus photosynthesis, though she would join us from time to time.

"You're going to visit the local television studio, right?" Diana asked.

"Of course," I responded, not knowing where she's going with this.

"Don't say anything stupid."

"Of course. Wait what?"

"I don't know, like suggesting that you don't have a soul."

"Hey, that's the truth!"

"It may be the truth, but it's incendiary, like dissing Christianity."

"Because Christianity is a bunch of hokey pokey, even Sasaki agreed."

"Don't you understand? We're public figures now. This is just different from working with a small group of people, this is you representing all of Earth."

"Babe, you don't trust me?"

"We're both outspoken sometime. Not afraid to say what's on our mind. However, that can get us in trouble."

"I am not going to lie on stage about what I believed."

"I am not asking you to do that. I just want you to be diplomatic."

After breakfast, I stepped into the street with my housemates. It was a narrow street, a reminder of an age when Vale did not have cars. Though it was not evident how crammed in the Kingdom itself was. Much of the land were devoted to agriculture, and time went on, increased efficiency allowed that sector to feed an increasingly large number of people, which then expanded into the farmland. However, much of the population growth were concentrated vertically more than horizontally, given that further cessation of land would meant starvation.

"Bye!" the ladies said as they went off to a different direction, with a hidden guard following behind. I went off to another direction, accompanied by another guard.

With first contact and public persona status, it wasn't unreasonable for crazy people to come out of the woodwork.
