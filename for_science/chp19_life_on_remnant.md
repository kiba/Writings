It was another morning on the planet Remnant in an oddly familiar surrounding, an apartment. There wasn't too much different from Earth. There's a restroom, bedroom, kitchen, and a dining room.

Early on, Diana, Sasaki, and I decided to pool our resources together and save as much money as possible so that we can build up personal access to resources.

So I ended up in a slightly run down apartment in a slightly run down neighborhood, currently cooking pancakes and scrambled eggs.

It was just Diana and me for breakfast, as usual. Sasaki was off sunbathing in the bathroom, doing higeus photosynthesis, though she would join us from time to time.

"You're going to visit the local television studio, right?" Diana asked.

"Of course," I responded, not knowing where she's going with this.

"Don't say anything stupid."

"Of course. Wait what?"

"I don't know, like suggesting that you don't have a soul."

"Hey, that's the truth!"

"It may be the truth, but it's incendiary, like dissing Christianity."

"Because Christianity is a bunch of hokey pokey, even Sasaki agreed."

"Don't you understand? We're public figures now. This is just different from working with a small group of people, this is you representing all of Earth."

"Babe, you don't trust me?"

"We're both outspoken sometime. Not afraid to say what's on our mind. However, that can get us in trouble."

"I am not going to lie on stage about what I believed."

"I am not asking you to do that. I just want you to be diplomatic."

After breakfast, I stepped into the street with my housemates. It was a narrow street, a reminder of an age when Vale did not have cars. Though it was not evident how crammed in the Kingdom itself was. Much of the land were devoted to agriculture, and time went on, increased efficiency allowed that sector to feed an increasingly large number of people, which then expanded into the farmland. However, much of the population growth were concentrated vertically more than horizontally, given that further cessation of land would meant starvation.

"Bye!" the ladies said as they went off to a different direction, with a hidden guard following behind. I went off to another direction, accompanied by another guard.

With first contact and public persona status, it wasn't unreasonable for crazy people to come out of the woodwork.
