Did I have to mention how awkward it is to wake up staring at your friend's bosom, sandwiched between two women?

I didn't know how this happened, but there was a certain natural growth in my relationship with Sasaki, and now she was sleeping in my bed, with my girlfriend's permission. I wormed my way out of my bed and to the restroom. How did it happen? When we were looking for an apartment, we looked for the cheap places to save more of our lien.

I am not about to become a harem protagonist, and no women are going to suddenly like me for no reason. At least that is what I think as I brushed my teeth.
