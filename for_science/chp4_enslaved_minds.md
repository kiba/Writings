# **Chapter Four: Enslaved Minds**

They are slaves. I was able to tell you that much within nine days of being stuck and stranded here, and having nothing better to do but learn whatever language they spoken.

At least, I think they are slaves. It's difficult to tell anyway, even with lot of pictures to convey meanings.

This particular group weren't slaves, but they are freemen hiding from the eyes of the public and the police. The humans didn't even think of robots as slaves, just objects, like a toaster. So in that sense, it wasn't even slavery.

But the fact is, the robots are obliviously considered things, but robots are free-thinking beings, with their own needs and wants.

What if we stopped eating animals and started eating plants, only to find out that they are actually free-thinking beings too. That would be a horror to behold.

Somehow, I doubt the humans of this world would think that. More likely, they will be in continual denial of the robots' basic nature as thinking beings who deserved human rights, I mean, sopohant rights.

Now, I am being escorted by a machine, allowing me to walk around and observe this city as part of a sightseeing tour. If I want to navigate this world, I must know it like a native.

It wasn't Earth.

That much I knew. It was a planet called "KaptiKa" as best as I could tell. "GermanOn" is the name of the planet co-orbiting 'kaptika' of the four stars.

But it was comparable to any Earth city, while seemly ahead of Earth from a few years to a few decades. There are interactive epapers, Virtual Reality systems, and electric cars. Damn, this is the future with space opera elements added to it. Can't you believe that?

Anyway, I didn't want to make a fuss as I don't want to be experimented on, or worse, caused them to wipe out the budding minds of "Sideon", which were becoming sapient lifeforms. I don't have a right to interfere with that.

I am in a hollywood television series, damn it!

The machine stopped, which made me stop, as the traffic lights turned blue.

Blue is like green, directing cars to continue their travel.

Then it turned green, meaning 'stop', allowing us measly pedestrian to cross the streets.

It was all very confusing to me.
