**James Archer**

Diana and I finally found myself seated in a meeting room the opposite side of Captain Kobayashi, the commander-in-chief of Sidonia. Naturally, there were butterflies in my stomach as our freedom were on the lines.

The captain was pretty mysterious. Her masks helped, no doubt, as nobody knew her face. Moreover, her biography was entirely empty saved a record of her activities as executive, which weren't always looked upon postively by the citizenry. Turned out that there's a couple of independent poll organization and the approval was never ninety-nine percent.

Anyway, we were at a severe disadvantage in term of information. The negotiation weren't certainly between two co-equal force.

"Archer and Rose, let us get straight to the point, shall we?" the captain said. "Your machine is our salvation, and because of that, we won't let you go until we come to some sort of agreement regarding its use and study."

"Is that a threat?" Diana asked.

"Do I need to pretend it is not? We can do this the hard way, or the easy way."

"No, I get it," I replied.

"But..." Diana said, with a loss for words.

"What are your conditions?"

"First, give us everything you know about trans-dimensional travel and how to build such a device. "

"I am afraid that I can't do in one sitting or without some kind of compensation. I need to get back home. My girlfriend just quitted her job."

"Compensation can be worked out."
