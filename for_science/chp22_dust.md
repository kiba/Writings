We stayed after the celebration to work on the next iteration of the trans-dimensional machine, this time actually building a working spacecraft.

Diana wasn't available, she was working on her education. So only Sasaki and I arrived at the headquarter of her company.

In retrospect, I shouldn't expect resistances from Sidonians on the new polyamorous relationship with Sasaki and Diana. The Sidonians accepted it without much issue. On the surface, they are a conservative society modeled after the Japanese, but they are able to accept people with radically different body plans, cyborgs, and third genders with relative ease. Dating two women? Not even on their radar.
