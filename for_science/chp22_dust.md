We stayed after the celebration to work on the next iteration of the trans-dimensional machine, this time actually building a working spacecraft.

Diana wasn't available, she was working on her education. So only Sasaki and I were at the headquarter of her company, or more specifically at the hangar next to their headquarter.

It looked, well, like a hangar, and there was a shuttle design, the next generation TDM, this time fitted with experimental rocket engines, suitable for both atmospheric and vacuum flight. It was Colonial technology, though the fuel mixture was tylium infused with fire dust for improved thrust and specific impulse.

"Archer-san? I heard all about you from Sasaki here," an engineer said. "My name is
Shinsuke Tanba, and I run the company when Sasaki isn't around."

"Ah. Well, Sasaki talked a lot about work a lot, so I know of you as well," I responded. "I am looking forward to working with you as well."

That's it. No mention of the new relationship that was probably known by half of the crew here. In retrospect, there was no visible reactions from the Sidonians, even though polyamorous wasn't exactly the most common type of relationship. I seared on their net, and there was little in the way of gossips.

My fear was unfounded, but it doesn't mean that I won't continually worry about it. Isn't that kind of relationship reserved for harem manga? I wasn't exactly the big hero, or the most important person across the multiverse, and I am certainly not gaining powers like a shounen protagonist. My life was more subdued. Yet, I somehow ended up achieving a fantasy of mine. Though said fantasy wasn't anything effortless. I wanted to abort but I don't want to.

"HEY!" Sasaki said, jolting me out of my thought process. "What are you thinking about."

"Nothing." My face went slightly red.

"Huh-uh." I could feel the sarcasm that was dripping off of her. She knew that I was lying. "We're getting ready to launch the TDM."

The hangar was cleared of personnels, and was opened to vacuum, and we were sequestered into a control room stuffed full of people. We were watching the shuttle on screen, which remarkably resembled a dreamchaser. The Sidonians aren't incapable of imagination, but why reinvent the wheel when they got something just as good if not better than any of them could come up?

"Three, two, one...ignition!" the launch conductor said.

The engines in the back of the shuttle roared to life, and it took off.
