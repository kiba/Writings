After the celebration of newly created Cylon, we stayed to catch up on development happening on Sidonia, mainly the next generation TDM design which will be spaceflight capable, but also other technological and scientific development as well.

Diana wasn't here today, as she was taking an exam for her degree. That left Sasaki and I at the headquarter of Toha Heavy industry, her company, more specifically a hangar.

The hangar, of course, looked like an industrial building. Catwalks and floors opened to an empty space on all sides, with gantries in the ceiling, and railings on the floor. There was several airlocks to space where the catwalks don't meet.

"Archer-san? I heard all about you from Sasaki here," an engineer said. "My name is
Shinsuke Tanba, and I run the company when Sasaki isn't around."

"Ah. Well, Sasaki talked a lot about work a lot, so I know of you as well," I responded. "I am looking forward to working with you as well."

If he knew of our new-found relationship, he didn't show it, or he didn't care. Polyamorous relationships were unusual, but it didn't warranted any social reactions, or so I been told. Still, my anxiety wasn't going to exactly go away.

It's certainly isn't anything like a harem anime, that's for sure.

"HEY!" Sasaki said, jolting me out of my thought process. "What are you thinking about?"

"Nothing." My face went slightly red.

"Huh-uh." I could feel the sarcasm that was dripping off of her. She knew that I was lying. "We're getting ready to test the engine."

A small engine rolled into view. Instantly, I knew right away what it was. For anyone even slightly familiar with rocketry, it's a rocket engine.

The hangar was cleared of all personnels, and we were sequestered into a control room where employees monitored the testing. I was simply a bystander in this whole situation, but I could feel the excitement in the room as the place went through a final last check.

"Three, two, one...ignition!" an employee announced.

The rocket engine roared to life, struggling to free itself from the grasp of the clamps.

Indistinct cheers erupted once the rocket fell silent, signaling success.

"Impressive isn't it?" Tanba said. "We simply updated the materials used in the Colonial design and radically simplified the design. By itself, the rocket engines are a very impressive piece of Colonial engineering, even better than our own ion thrusters. With gravity plates, it's an absolute cakewalk."

"It can overcome the tyranny of the rocket equation much easier than ours, but it's relative specific impulse is terrible," Sasaki pointed out. "It's not great for long duration space journey, but their FTL drive will negate any need for it. Colonial civilization is based on mining ready-made tylium deposits, but we'll have to synthesize our own, ditto for the fire dust we mixed into it, until we can start importing the later."

"I supposed it would not be the kind of engines that you're going to use on a daily basis?" I asked.

"The efficiency and recycling ethos of Sidonian society still is very strong," Tanba acknowledged. "But there are specific applications where Colonial rocket engines could make a difference, such as our gardes, which needed them for maneuverability to improve the already atrocious attrition rate. Improving survivability is a much bigger priority then making energy efficient war machines, but we were always constrained by logistics, which should be less of a problem over the next few years given access to FTL and trans-dimensional drives."

"But then your constraint will be manpower to man all the factories and processing facilities?"

"We'll deal with the constraint when we cross the bridge."

"So, I won't see the engines in the next generation TDM?"

"We don't have the infrastructure in place," Sasaki noted. "Ion engines are all what we will be using in the foreseeable future. Even if that were the case Tylium-dust sublight engines will still be restricted to military vessels until the economy grows."

"Bumper."

I could already see the possibility for tylium-dust engines and a space-borne capable TDM. We could travel back to the Colonials again.

Alas, the Sidonians already have too much on their plate to try a first contact with a civilization that's possibility at war.

**Walter Schnee**
**September 27, 2015**
**Schnee Dust Company HQ, Atlas**

It wasn't alway like this. It had been years ago that Walter Schnee would be able to go anywhere as he pleased, without guards hovering nearby. The White Fang changed everything.

The terrorist organization targeted his company's refining facilities, warehouses, retail locations, and other company infrastructure. They not only attacked the company's properties, but also the people who worked for the company, at all the level of the business' hierarchy. Members of the board, including family members were targets of assassination and bombing campaigns.

There were no hostages, ransoms, or even dialogue. If they wanted to terrorize his company, then they're wrong. The only response Schnee and his company can give, is to double down and not surrender.

Although the attacks has abated recently, the paranoia still permeated the air. As long as the White Fang still exists, he wasn't going to let down his guard, given that he had paid it too many times in the past. As such, he hired only human security professionals, and there was never less than a fifty guard strong contingent just to protect the board and his family, and at least a pair of guards that accompany him by his side to wherever he went.

The only exception that security wasn't allowed in: his office. As soon as he made it, the guards posted themselves by the side of the door.

He made no acknowledgement of their service. There were far too many people who helped in his daily tasks small or large. His time was too valuable to say 'thanks' to every single individuals.

As soon he entered his office, the atmosphere of paranoia changed. A new threat made itself the new focus, the foreigners.

He remembered when they arrived. At the time, the only thing that the media wanted to talk about was first contact. He thought that there might be a new potential market for his products, but that was quickly dashed when the foreigners talked about their 'Higeus' particles, a source of unlimited renewable energy, and their knowledge of engineer and science without dust that went beyond Remnant's technological prowness.

They probably have only peaceful intention, but they were a threat to the business that the Schnee family had built over the successive two generations.

The elder head of the Schnee seated himself, started up his computer and logged into his email account.

The headings of memos and reports filled the transparent holographic monitor, the computer downloading information from the cross continental transmit system.

A message caught his eyes.

The demand of dusts was growing every month with no time of stopping, and projection predicted healthy demand, sending the price of dust slowly upward.

It didn't make sense to him. His company and his rivals were doing everything to obstruct the development of Higeus energy generation sources, and to dissuade dust users from jumping the ship, or even using more efficient dust processes pioneered by foreigners.

Nothing was working in the slightest, or failed to reverse the flow to where it was in the past.

He thought about hiring more chemists and increasing the R&D budget to create new demand for dusts to try to stem the coming tide, dipping through the treasury and maybe even taking money from other departments.

The question wasn't really should he do it, but how much at what expense.

A notification pinged; a report from the intelligence director.

After reading the report, he laid back into his chair, thinking through the implications.
It appeared that he made a major miscalculation. The foreigners were already buying bigger quantity of dusts, though currently at insignificant percentage of the market. He imagined that they could expand to even bigger purchases because they found new uses for dust?

If that was the case, then he might have nothing to fear from the foreigners at all.

**Violent Amethyst**
**September 29, 2015**

For the past few weeks, Doctor Violent Amethyst was working on a new cooling system for heat exchange under the 'watchful eyes' of her boss, though that seemed unwarranted these day. She did not make anything resembling a 'tinkertech' device, which would earn the ire of her boss, despite his own propensity to create these same devices. Of course, the major difference was that it was his semblance. She had no such excuses.

Still, the harsh and blunt criticism did wonder for her reputation,, now that her papers can be understood by other researchers and engineers.

The new cooling system was not overly exotic in concept. It worked pretty much like watercooling, except for a higher performance envelope for cooling objects.

The device itself was a bulky apparatus, about the size of a minifridge, connected to another apparatus that can generate a lot of heat in a very short time period.

The system worked, sort of, if only for two minutes last time. It may worked like watercooling, but in practice, it was slightly more complicated than that. That resulted in all sort of breakage, forcing her to diagnose and fix before retesting it again. Last time, her new ice dust slurry spontaneously created ice dust inside the machine, cogging up the device, causing all sort of side effects, resulting in overheating and not enough cooling.

So, her blender worked double time toward a new recipe. She understood how her formula worked, if quite unclear on the specific details. That wasn't important right now, only that she knew the direction where to take her new recipe.

She wasn't looking to make it the best or perfect slurry, just a slurry that didn't break the machine and achieve the performance benchmark.

The whirling stopped. The woman immediately poured the newly mixed slurry into the machine tank.

"Test Thirty One, using new slurry formula seventy two," she said. Then she switched on both apparatuses.

Data streamed in from the sensors to a monitor nearby.

The cooling system chugged along with the low whine of the heating element.

"So far so good...," she said at the five minute mark.

If it worked, it would be quite revolutionary. She was assured by the Sidonians that she wouldn't be wasting her time working on something that would be inferior to any solution that they have in their database.

Seven minutes passed. Then, eight, nine, and finally, ten minutes.

Satisfied, she switched off the machine. A smile was plastered on her face.

She supposed that she could go further to test the limit of the machine's reliability, but it was already past lunch. Time to get lunch.

**September 30, 2015**

The violent colored woman yawned as she muddled in her routine, fighting against a very strong desire to go back to sleep, a consequence of working too late in the evening.

She broke out Pumpkin Pete's cereal featuring a young redhead huntress on the cover, poured milk into the cereal bowl, settled down on her table to eat, and switched on the television morning news.

"-spontaneously protest this morning against rumored new inventions coming out of the project that the protestors will say destroy their jobs. Despite assurance from the director to the public, the number of protestors continued to rise..."

She almost spitted out her cereal in shock.

The protestors were so much part of the background that she ignored it all in favor of her work and not getting fired. It didn't occur to her to think about her work in a larger context other than expanding the technological possibility.

"Oh no, I will have come to work today," she whined.

Normally, the boss usually juggled public relation duties part time to defend the organization and raises its profile. However, the boss was still on vacation.

How was she supposed to deal with this?

***

It didn't take a genuis to notice that a lot more policement were present than the several weeks before. The protestors were also set back more than usual, behind police lines.

Angry yells and slogans still penetrated the street as she crossed the street to her workplace, trying to avoid any glances from the protestors.

Finally, she arrived in the building's atrium. She presented her card and her scroll to security for verification, before finally passing through.

She sighed.  

Since when did life became so complicated?

***

"Hello?" she answered her scroll.

"Is this Miss Amethyst?" an unfamiliar male voice asked.

"Yes?"

"I am representing the Schnee Dust Company, and we just heard of a new breakthrough in cooling solutions based on the use of ice dust. Is this true?"

"How-" She decided to not ask that question until later. "Yes, it's true, but it's very exper-"

"Of course, it might not pan out as a practical industrial solution. In our experience, R&D is unpredictable. Nonetheless, The Schnee Dust company recognize your expertise and we would like to capitalize on that opportunity. We would like to offer you a fifty thousand lien bonus for signing on, twice the matching salary of their research fellow, free healthcare, unlimited first class airline tickets, your own office and secretary and of course, autonomy and freedom to pursue any dust-related research topics you so desire."

"Wow, umm...let me think about it."

"Sure thing, when can we talk about our offer to you?"

"Tomorrow."

Why would she stay here, and why she didn't answer 'yes'? Although she learned a lot from that bastard of a boss, she desired freedom from him and the bureaucracy, and she very liked the idea of being able to pursue research in peace.

In spite of that, why Violent Amethyst was hesitating?

"I am going to sleep on that," she decided for now.
