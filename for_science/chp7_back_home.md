# **Chapter Seven: Back Home**
**February 24, 2015**

One moment, there was nothing in my garage, sans the tools and other junks. Then, the next second, there was a "pew" sound, as if it was made by a science fiction laser.

There was something now.

I was laden with a complete Cylon unit and an additional three computation engines, the heart and souls of those Cylons.

Immediately, I was disoriented, about to throw up. The smell form the garbage piled up in my garage didn't help either.

I walked to the bathroom as best as I could, making my way to the toilet. Then I puked out the content of my stomach.

After my puking, I swallowed an anti-puking pill, courtesy of Colonial medicine, with water to help it down.

Finally, I staggered toward the garage again.

"God, must be the garbage I forgot to take out!" I said.

"if I may, I could take out the trash," Delta Zero Three One, the name of the functioning Cylon, said.

"No, don't. I don't want the world to know of your existence. Come into the living room."

The content of the trans-dimensional machine were left behind as the two thinking beings close the garage behind them.

"First order of business, I need the nausea to pass away so I can get my thinking cap screwed on straight."

"Affirmative."

I sat on a couch, still dealing with the aftereffect of a trans-dimensional jump while the robot stood still as a statue, with its eyes roving.

It wasn't long before I passed into a peaceful nap.

***
**Two hours later.**

I finally woke up from the slumber, with the bot in front of me.

"Greeting," it said.

"Greeting, Delta. How long I was in nap-mode?" I asked.

"Two Caprican hours," it said.

"That long? Jesus. I need to improve the machine so it stops giving me the jumpitis."

Great, my mad science persona was speaking again.

"We need to survey our resources and liability," the machine reminded me.

"Right. Our liability currently consists of about seventy thousand dollars in debt, with twenty percent interest due in about two weeks time. Fourteen thousand dollars must be serviced next month. That's more than I fucking made in a single month in my entire career!"

In other words, I was in deep shit. Nothing like getting a loan, maxing out my credit card, and lying to girlfriend, friends, co-workers, and family to worsen the deal.

The machine responded by listing assets.

Ten Colonial kilogram of pure platinum, three Cylon computation engines, Delta Three Zero One, me, the trans-dimensional machine, two tablets with technical details on Colonial engineering, a whole bunch of machines.

"And we have random shit in my house," I said. "Tools and parts. I don't know exactly how useful they are right now."

"We must find out exactly where we stand and we must service your debt," it said.

"Yes. I'll go and look up the price of platinum."

But before I can do so, the doorbell rang.

"SHIT! Somebody's here! Go hide."

"Affirmative," it responded as it walked silently into another part of my house.

Up against the door, I sighted through the peephole. Of all the people who had to be there, it was someone that I didn't want to see the most.

OhfrakgodwhatdidIgotmyselfinto?

My heart raced like never before as I opened the door.

It was my girlfriend, a redhead with blue eyes and a ponytail. She looked angry and relieved.

"Where the fuck you been? Why hadn't you been answering your phone?" she asked very rapidly.

"Umumumumumum."

I had no answer as abject terror took over my face.

What could I say? I traveled to a different part of the multiverse unwillingly? Met enslaved AI and brought four of them back with me?

What the fuck am I supposed to tell her?

Her anger silently increased along with her fear. It's scary how much people can care about each other.

I am so fucked.

Then I smiled. My body contorted in ways that was seemingly impossible. The abject terror that was on my face melted away.

"Babe," I said in my sexiest voice. "You don't know what I am up to."

My mad scientist personality took over.

Her eyebrow twitched in confusion.

Then my body grabbed her.

"Delta!" the mad scientist said. "Come out!"

The lumbering machine slowly slid into view.

"This is delta," I announced. "It is an artificial intelligence that I freed from across the multiverse."

"What?"

"Greeting," it said in a mechanical voice and in English.

The clearly mechanical machine walked forward to demonstrate its smoothness of operation.

"You built a robot? Why you didn't answer the fricking door!" she yelled.

"I didn't build it. I freed it from slavery," I repeated.

"From where?"

"Across the multiverse!"

"My benefactor is correct," Delta concurred.

"Who's the hell operating the device?" she questioned.

"Nobody! That's what I am trying to tell you!"

"Stop feeding me that bullshit. This is not funny."

"Babe, this time I am not lying."

I faced her with resoluteness, but also with sheer fear. I didn't know what I will do if she didn't believe my story. Presumably, my alternative personality will rescue me again.

It's like I am in a bad fanfiction or something.

This time, she relaxed.

"It's all still bullshit to me," she affirmed once again her disbelief. "But half of my mind is saying that you're not bullshitting me. "

"You believed me?"

"Fuck no! But you owe me something else."

"I do?"

"Us. Alone time. In the bedroom now." I immediately followed her order.

Then she turned to the robot and smiled. "Sorry, please make yourself at home while I make love to this idiot."

Finally, once the bedroom door was closed and we were alone.

"You know, I was about to call the police if you didn't answer the door," she said.

"But now I am back."

"Yes, and I was on the edge of simply calling the police again. But I took a leap of faith right now right here. Am I wrong?"

"No."

"Then you better be explaining everything to me after this is all over."

Thank god for small mercy.

After that we kissed passionately.

[i]Dear Journal,

It turned out that I got enough platinum to wipe out my entire debt. A kilogram of platinum sold for twenty thousand dollars, for instance, enough to service my debt for a single month.

But I got another problem: no paper trail for where I got my platinum. This was problematic, but at least not so bad as missing a deadline. So I am keeping off my debt for a moment.

My girlfriend came around and believed us. Bad news, she's now my partner in this whole endeavor. At least she understood mechanical engineering and she'll be able to contribute. Though it took a while for me to convince her not to confine me to a mental ward.

I knew I am insane at time, but that insanity had served me well, despite my reservation.

Speaking of Cylons, Delta set up a trading account in my name and port over a program over the past two weeks. When it was up and running, it served as another source of revenues even if it only make cents per hour. Delta assured me that this was an extremely conservative operation, at least until it set up a more sophisticated trading system.

Currently, Diana and I were focusing on building an exoskeleton suit to present to potential investors. The Cylons were a marvel of engineering compared to ours, software and hardware. It should not be hard to adapt the locomotion system for human uses. Hopefully, the money comes before I had to pay with platinum again, but that is unlikely.[/i]
