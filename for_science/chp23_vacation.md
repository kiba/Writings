# **Chapter Twenty-three: Vacation**

**Deserted Island, Earth**

It was the stereotypical deserted island, with palm trees and coconuts, and a beautiful picture perfect beach. The nearest civilization on Earth was at least several hundred miles away, which makes it all the more a perfect vacation spot. There was plenty of privacy and almost no way for other humans to bother us. So there's little chance of first contact being made here, creating an out-of-control situation for the Sidonians.

Of course, I transited to this tiny island using a TDM, from Sidonia. We made sure that this island wasn't on anyone's map, neither in the Sidonian knowledge base nor on google or any other sources. Lastly, we scouted the island to make extra sure.

 My girlfriends and I made sure to pack for a two weeks stay, with fridge, showerheads, water purifier, and other camping supplies. All of which were military issue intended for the new infantry branch. The only price was a detailed report for the firm that made it and to military command, as well a return of all equipment at the end of our vacation.

"So this is a beach on Earth," Sasaki observed. "It exists in a vast expanse of a very resilient biosphere."

I wasn't really thinking about that, but thinking about how Sasaki and Diana made it their mission to maximally embarrass me in public by proclaiming their relationships with me in front of me with other people.

Worst, I couldn't convince myself to tell them to stop. It wasn't my purpose to make our relationship secret, as if I was involved in an illicit affair.

It was to my releif that there were to be no other people around, and I could sit back and relax, without feeling all too conscious of myself.

"Well, what you're waiting for?" Diana said, dragging me by my hand into the water. Sasaki followed along as well. We splashed into the water of the Pacific Ocean.

***

A crab tattered about in the sand before Sasaki. My girlfriend didn't look the slightest scared. Only minutes ago, she was barefooted, and now she already got boots on her feets.

Quickly, she stomped the crab in one motion with her left foot. The crab cracked like a sand of soda, its limbs lashing out in one final death keel before ceasing altogether.

It was unreal and gruesome.

"Do you really need to kill that crab?" I said in dismay.

"What's the problem?" Sasaki asked. "We're getting local food. Don't they said that local is the best?"

"I am sure that's a myth. But killing an animal is unnecessary when we got a freezer full of artificially grown meat. We're not savages."

"Oh, Mr. Morality, you're going to lecture me on why we should not eat meat when you have been eating meat all your life, especially on Remnant?"

"My contemporary and I got more excuses for it. We don't grow meat cultures."

"Uh huh." Her voice dripped with sarcasm. "In that case, the crab was going to die horribly by being eaten by a predator or some other means. At least this was a quick death." A quick and painful death, maybe.

I sensed that this wasn't going anywhere. So I decided to drop it.

Sasaki dropped the crab into a pot and then continued her crab hunting mini-excursion.

So crab for breakfast, lunch, and dinner it is.

***

It was sheer coincidence that I ended up doing the grilling, which was traditonally a male role. We did a rock-paper-scissor game to decide our chores, and I happened to end up winning.

So I stood over an open flame letting the artificial meats and crab alike sizzle. Sasaki was out there again, hunting for more meat, and bringing down coconuts.

Diana was nearby, preparing kebabs for me to cook.

"I wanted to know...where are we going from here with this relationship?" Diana broached the topic.

I closed my eyes to think a little bit. "I don't know. I loved you and Sasaki but I probably will not try this again in any future relationships." Though I don't think about it much, but I knew that it's unlikely that we will be together forever.

Diana snorted. "Oh, what a guy wouldn't give for a harem?"

I turned beet red, turning my head away from her. "Please..."

"If it helps, I couldn't think of any other guy who would be able to handle a relationship like ours."

"Well, I felt like a douchebag for just having the two of you as my girlfriends," I admitted. "It's like the rule of evil or something. It would mark you the greatest level of asshole or something. That's nonsense, but I can't shake it off."

"At least you're not blushing as much as before. I'll keep doing it until you stopped being so embarrassed and scared."

I could picture in my head the celebrity gossip in the magazine section about boring oh me and my girlfriends. It was not a secret at all. Also unmentioned is going to Diana's family and explaining to them what we are doing. They're not exactly the most open people around.

After some fun and sexy times, we elected to sleep outside under the sky, not even with blankets covering us. Instead, we let the cool air flowed over us. It was a good thing that there will be no inclement weather covering this island tonight. The only sounds were the waves crashing into the sands, which added to the positive ambient experience. With all the light sources turned off, it was almost entirely dark. Yet, there were an entire ocean of lights emanating from the stars.

Unsurprisingly, it was like nothing I had seen back on Vale. Light pollution had stolen the view from urban residents.

It was a shame that Diana was fast asleep as soon she hit the blanket.

"Beautiful isn't it?" Sasaki said. Meteorites suddenly streaked though the sky, burning up in the atmosphere, creating shooting stars. "Sometime, I used to go outside Sidonia in my suit and just look into the vacuum of space. All those lights took years, sometime thousands, millions, even billions to reach us."

"Boy I wished I could live as long as those stars," I said. "There's so little time in a human lifespan to do anything."

"Immortality. You're obsessed with it."

"I wouldn't say obsessed, just that I have a healthy point of view."

"Death is not scary in a way. When you die, it's 'poof'. Actually, it's not even that. You're just gone. When I was young, what terrified me is growing old. Eventually, your body and mental faculty breaks down until you're a shadow of yourself. Even though we can grow new organs to replace old ones, it can only do so much."

"You know, I think trans-dimensional travel holds a possibility of finding a cure to aging. If even the Sidonians can't manage it..."

"Hmm..."

"Come to think of it. There aren't gauna in my home reality, right?"

"God, I hope not. The historical timeline matched up perfectly so far, though that's quickly going out the window. But I expect the gauna won't show up for about two century, if they're still out there. As far as we know, the gauna cannot do FTL."

"Then we have some time. Time to improve our technological base to hopefully solve aging and being ready for the gauna. There got to be a solution in the multiverse, right?"

"Sidonian technology is limited by manpower more than anything else. Dust tech is still a very immature field. Colonial tech...however, beside from their solid engineering tradition, they're surprisingly not all that advanced aside from FTL drive, antigravity, and computer science. So we already got a lot of work cut out for us. Maybe opening a portal to another universe with a completely tech base will speed up, but it will also throw existing research effort into chaos, maybe even slow it down if the new tech isn't amazing enough."

"Shop talk...we never stop talking about it," I remarked. "Even on this beach on a deserted island."

"James...that's pretty much the only thing you talked about. With Diana, we talked about normal human being stuff more."

Jesus, am I really that terrible? Though my girlfriends do seem to talk amongst themselves a lot.

"Then, you should tell me if I am boring the heck out of you."

"I don't mind it at all. Not at all."

We stopped talking after that, letting the silence took over. It wasn't long before I fell into a slumber.

It was out of the blue. Sasaki interrupted a board game session and called for us to discuss something important, immediately. Though it wasn't so urgent, apparently given that we have teacups and teapots. We assembled in a circle on around of a badly made wooden board I was working on to satisfy my restlessness.

There were a whole of silence as our eyes rested on Sasaki.

She closed her eyes and made deep sigh. I could tell that it wasn't going to be easy for her.

"Diana wasn't awake during the first night when we discussed immortality," she said. "The idea that we do not possess immortality is a lie. There's a conspiracy and I am part of it."

Wait, what?

"Excuse me?" Diana said.

"I am immortal."

"Is this your idea of a joke?" I said, looking to see if Sasaki is stiffing a laugh.

There wasn't any forthcoming. Instead, she looked even more serious.

"No. It's not a joke. There's really a conspiracy to keep the tech from the population. It has been going on even well before the apocalypse a hundred years ago."

"For what fucking reason?"

"There were justifications. Some good and not-so-good reasons. Social control, monopoly on power, concerns about population growth and social dynamism."

Fuck. I don't know what to think. I want to be angry at her, I really do, but I also loved her.

"Why now?" Diana questioned. "Why us of all people?"

"I didn't want to tell you until now. I want to enjoy all the time that I have left, before the upcoming constitutional crisis. Everything is going to go to shit once the conspiracy is blown wide open. The power that may be decided it's better to do it now rather than risk it later, rather than plunging the whole of Sidonia. The outsider's view provided a perspective that would otherwise be ignored and that got people to questions what they see in front of them."

"Well, there goes our vacation," Diana said softly.

"Well....I am going to take a walk to process this situation," I decided just now.

"Don't be gone so long. We're not done talking," Sasaki said.

***

After finishing my walk, Diana and I listened to Sasaki talked a very long story about the immortal ship committee and how they came into being, how they retain power, one of which was subverting conspiracy theorists into patsies, and how subtle social control works. Why censor when you can self-censor? Why oppress when you can make people ignore certain things?

That, of course, is coming fast apart, beginning with my arrival, and then accelerating with Remnant.

Was there's a point in doing anything on the last day? No matter what I do, I couldn't even begin to relax. So I just plopped my body in the shade. Sasaki was already dressed up, ready to go, resting her head against my shoulder. Diana was off somewhere, hunting for crabs, doing as much as possible to avoid Sasaki.

Sasaki shouldn't be my ally. I should be on the side of Sidonians who had been denied life-saving medicine for all their lives.

But this woman wormed my way to my heart. She was genuine in her friendship and romance, just as she was ordered by her boss, Captain Kobayashi. A boss that I grew to dislike even more, even as I understood her reasoning for her actions.

"Damn," I said. "Somebody got the same idea." We made sure that the island was truly deserted, and we did that by cross-checking current Earth database against the Sidonian historical database.

But nobody said that a submersible yacht was coming to check out the island out, especially as it creeped ever closer.

"Let's not stick around to find out. Pack everything. We're going home."

The trio of us scrambled away from the beach, running toward our campsite. The whole point of choosing this island was secrecy before first contact. Now we're scrambling to take away technological artifact strewn all over the place.

"I see a motorboat launching! Are we good?"

"We got everything!" Diana said. It was a good thing that we had a plan in place, and that there were rules for ensuring that we got everything back. Most importantly, most things were already packed.

"Nothing unaccounted for," Sasaki concurred.

"Great, let's us rev up the engine."

Just as the motorboat were closing in, we disappeared into thin air.
