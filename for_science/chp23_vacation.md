Who would had thought that there's vacation spots in Sidonia? I didn't know of any such spots until Sasaki suggested to me. There's a beautiful beach with actual water and fishes, like on Earth. It's also strangely empty of anybody but us.

I luxuriated in the shade while I watched Sasaki and Diana splashed water at each other in their beachwears.

If this were an anime, it would be a beach episode where we get to have fun while holding off earth-shattering consequences. No, there were no great evil to defeat or really an overarching goal I have in mind, despite my various accomplishments.

My girlfriends began walking up to me as they chattered among themselves without me understanding any of it.
