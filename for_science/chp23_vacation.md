**Deserted Island, Earth**

It was the stereotypical deserted island, with palm tree and coconuts, and a beautiful beach. The nearest civilization on Earth was at least several hundred miles away. Which makes it all the more a perfect vacation spot. There was plenty of privacy and almost no way for other humans to bother us.

I arrived here with my TDM, transiting from Sidonia to this island, which was referenced from the Sidonian knowledge base, and then scouted. The last thing I wanted was some Grimms making its way to Earth. My girlfriends and I made sure to pack for a four day stay, with fridge, showerheads, water purifier, and other camping supplies. All of which were military issued for the new infantry branch. The only price was a detailed report for the firm that made it.

"So this is a beach on Earth," Sasaki said.
