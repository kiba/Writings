**Deserted Island, Earth**

It was the stereotypical deserted island, with palm tree and coconuts, and a beautiful beach. The nearest civilization on Earth was at least several hundred miles away. Which makes it all the more a perfect vacation spot. There was plenty of privacy and almost no way for other humans to bother us.

I arrived here with my TDM, transiting from Sidonia to this island, which was referenced from the Sidonian knowledge base, and then scouted. The last thing I wanted was some Grimms making its way to Earth. My girlfriends and I made sure to pack for a four day stay, with fridge, showerheads, water purifier, and other camping supplies. All of which were military issue intended for the new infantry branch. The only price was a detailed report for the firm that made it and to military command.

"So this is a beach on Earth," Sasaki observed. "Existing in a vast expanse of resilient biosphere."

I wasn't really thinking about that, but thinking about how Sasaki and Diana made it their mission to maximally embarrass me in public by proclaiming their relationships with me in front of me with other people once they overcame their reservation.

Worst, I couldn't convince myself to tell them to stop, especially when they were talking to remnan humans.

Now, there was no way of that happening, since there aren't other people around, and I could sit back and relax.

"Well, what you're waiting for?" Diana said, dragging me by my hand into the water. Sasaki followed along as well. We splashed into the water of the Pacific Ocean.

A crab tattered about in the sand before Sasaki. My girlfriend didn't look the slightest scared. It appeared that she got boots on her legs where it was only bare footed only minutes ago.

Quickly, she stomped the crab in one motion with her left foot. The crab cracked.

It was unreal and gruesome.

"Do you really need to kill that crab?" I said in dismay.

"What's the problem?" Sasaki asked. "We're getting local food. Don't they said that local is the best."

"I am sure that's a myth. But killing an animal is unnecessary when we got a freezer full of artificially grown meat. We're not savages."

"Oh, Mr. Morality, you're going to lecture me on why we should not eat meat when you have been eating meat all your life?"

"My contemporary and I got more excuses for it. We don't grow meat."

"Uh huh," Sasaki said sarcastically.

What did Diana and James talked about?

***

Sasaki talks hypothetical about immortality.

With no clouds in the region, we made a conscious decision to simply sleep under the night sky. With all the lights and electronics turned off, it was almost entirely dark. Yet there were lights from the stars, an ocean of them.

Light pollution had obscured almost all of them where my home on Earth was located.
