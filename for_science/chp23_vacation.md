**Deserted Island, Earth**

It was the stereotypical deserted island, with palm tree and coconuts, and a beautiful beach. The nearest civilization on Earth was at least several hundred miles away. Which makes it all the more a perfect vacation spot. There was plenty of privacy and almost no way for other humans to bother us.

I arrived here with my TDM, transiting from Sidonia to this island, which was referenced from the Sidonian knowledge base, and then scouted. The last thing I wanted was some Grimms making its way to Earth. My girlfriends and I made sure to pack for a four day stay, with fridge, showerheads, water purifier, and other camping supplies. All of which were military issued for the new infantry branch. The only price was a detailed report for the firm that made it and to military command.

"So this is a beach on Earth," Sasaki observed. "Existing in a vast expanse of resilient biosphere."

I wasn't really thinking about that, but thinking about how Sasaki and Diana made it their mission to maximally embarrass me in public by proclaiming their relationships with me in front of me with other people once they overcame their reservation.

Worst, I couldn't convince myself to tell them to stop, especially when they were talking to remnan humans.

Now, there was no way of that happening, since there aren't other people around, and I could sit back and relax.

"Well, what you're waiting for?" Diana said, dragging me by my hand into the water. Sasaki followed along as well. We splashed into the water of the Pacific Ocean.
