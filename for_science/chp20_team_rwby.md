## **Chapter Twenty: Team RWBY**

[I]Dear Journal,

A number of breakthroughs had made their appearances after months of hard work and collaboration with all the parties involved.

We charted the stars, and we were able to locate Remnant and Sidonia in context of the Milky Way. Remnant is located around twenty five light years away from Earth, and Sidonia is located about three hundred twenty three light years away from Earth. The map was eventually published and distributed to the public at large.

Why star charting is important? Aside from knowing where we are, it will eventually enable trans-dimensional travel without me having to calculate all the numbers and arranging the schedules. However, star charting is simply the first step in a series required for practical interdimensional navigation. The principle behind it is simple. Travel to a certain location spatially, and then make the jump an alternate dimension before arriving at your destination. For example, you'll have to travel from Remnant twenty-five light years to Earth would be, then make the jump through several realities, before arriving at Earth proper.

That will require FTL travel if we want to arrive at any places soon, and the only method known to us is the Colonial jump-drive which can make point-to-point instantaneous jumps by folding space. The Cylons said that Colonial jump drive can only jump 2 light years at a time while exerting tremendous stress on both man and the machine. For our reference, Sidonia is about three hundred twenty three light years away from Earth, requiring about one hundred sixty one jumps, making such journey practically impossible for various reasons. If we were able to overcome such obstacles and get to our destination spatially, the last part is jumping dimensions and that required us overcoming a number of problems.

Before one can safely jump into dimensions and then finally arriving at the planet destination, one has to explore the dimensions first. Thankfully, we now have a way to probe dimensions for safety, which required future cosmological theory that only the Sidonians possessed. Mainly, we designed a machine which required about fifty megawatts per hour and occupy the size of a football field. Its main use is to search for compatible dimensions. Otherwise jumping blindly will cause retrocasual boundback effects, because that would be jumping into dimensions that doesn't exist. Even if a dimension exists, it doesn't mean that said dimension is fit to jump in, because it might not be compatible.

Finally, the last breakthrough in question was that the Sidonians are going ahead with gravitic plates production, an adoption of Colonial technology. Surprisingly, gravitic plates are one of the easiest technology to work with. The science behind it was simple, if widely agreed that it's almost impossible to discover even according to Sidonian science. According to the Cylons, this was heritage technologies inherited by the Colonials, from the series of arkships they arrived in from Kobol. It is unknown how the progenitor civilization discovered it.

Anyway, gravitic plates enabled cheap anti-gravity superior to Remnans' method, including extending it beyond atmosphere, but also cheap gravity as well, an essential component of space living if one do not want bone and muscle loss. With mass production of gravitic plates, they should be able to disable the extremely energy intensive gravity furnace, which costs sixty percent of Sidonia's power. Finally, gravitic plates can also serve as inertial compensator as a side effect of anti-gravity, which was fucking cheating the laws of physics. Theoretically, it can be used as an reaction-less drive, but it was deemed an inefficient use of energy compared to regular old reaction drives. Still, it is nonetheless another form of cheating the law of physics![/I]

**Trans-dimensional Reseach Laboratory Remnant**
**August 16, 2015**

I stared at a rube goldberg-equse contraption made by a certain violent colored researcher.

"What the fuck is this?" I said.

"It worked!" the researcher said. "As a result of my crea-"

"Cut the bullcrap about creativity and individuality," I said rather bluntly. I cursed director Polenda for making me a manager, for forcing me to agree to all too reasonable demands, rather than leaving me out of the bureaucracy surrounding scientific and engineering research.

"But your semblance..."

I stared at the violent eyed Remnan. "You forget. I am [i]soulless[/i]", to use a certain expression from protestors outdoor, which had since diminished. Though some researchers are still convinced that the aliens do have aura of some kind, if however small.

"Your power allowed you to create tinkertech devices."

"Which are basically useless without a serious amount of reverse engineering and painstaking scientific study, often in whole new fields of study. I don't have to reverse engineer your device, will I?"

The female engineer chuckled nervously. "No sir."

"Good, your project is now to reverse-engineer your own device and explain it so that other researchers can then build on your work using their [i]creativity[/i] and [i]individuality[/i]."

The woman sighed in relief that she wasn't going to get canned. Apparently, I am a very scary boss. It was near the end of a very short working day, as it was Sunday. Twelve PM had just hit, and it's time to head home, because a guest is coming over.

**Ruby Rose**
**Beacon Academy, Remnant**

There was something that Blake Belladonna was hiding from the rest of the team. Ruby don't know what, but it had something to do with Professor Oobleck. When Ruby tried to ask her, she tried to deflect it. When Yang or Weiss asked too, they got deflected as well.

So, three fourth were hiding together in a closet of their own dorm, waiting for Blake to do something.

"Psst. What do you see?" Yang asked.

"Nothing..." Ruby said.

Blake looked around the room for a little bit, before picking up a bookbag and heading outside.

The closet collapsed soon after into a pile of bodies. "Ouch!"

Ruby Rose stood up. "We got to go after Blake!" she proclaimed, pumping her fists up in the air.

***

As Blake made her way through the city of Vale, the team followed closely her every moves, taking care not to get caught. It didn't take very long until Blake entered the poorer neighborhood.

Then Blake finally arrived at a run down residence.

"Hey! You there!" a male voice shout out.

The girls were startled, and made their jump into the open, alerting Blake and a Sidonian.

***
**Archer's Apartment**
**Blake Belladonna**

"I presumed that they are your friends from that military academy?" Sasaki guessed. "Also here to visit my ancestors?"

Blake Belladonna was blindsided by her teammates. She didn't actually think that they will follow her. Actually, why wouldn't they?

"I-I..." Blake tried to answer. But nothing was readily coming out of her mouth.

Her teammates and a guard gradually approached the apartment, not taking long in such a narrow street. She could see the rather unhappy expressions on their faces, sorry about getting caught.

"These are your teammates? Miss Belladonna?" the somewhat anonymous guard questioned.

"Umm...yes."

"Hi Blake!" Ruby said cheerfully.

"What's sup, Blake," Yang greeted.

"What are you doing here?" Weiss said in a less friendly tone.

"She just wanted to talk to my ancestor about history for a report for Oobleck," Sasaki said.

"Did you piss off Oobleck?" Weiss wondered.

"I...uh...no!" Blake denied.

"Actually, Blake requested the meeting herself," Archer said, suddenly standing behind Sasaki. "She wanted to learn about the rights revolution on Earth. As a favor, she'll need to report her findings to Doctor Oobleck."

"We're going to be OK," Sasaki said to the guard. The guard nodded before melting away. Then she turned her attention to the four teenagers. "You brats can come in. We normally don't have much food in the house, because of our physiology, but today we have four Remnan houseguests."

Blake tried to look for an opening to run away, but her teammates would all be suspicious if she did that. She also didn't want to disappoint her host. However, anxiety was building up inside her.

She really wanted to run away, but her footstep was making the opposite decision.

"Well, are you going to come in or not?" the redhead woman asked.

Blake walked through.

***

As she entered Archer's home, Blake can tell that it wasn't any Remnan home she ever been to. They used more subdued and subtle colors, decorated with a foreign aesthetics that was unfamiliar.

"House rule is that you leave your footwears here," Archer said.

The girls nodded and began taking off their shoes and leaving it in the doorways.

"And it should be neatly arranged." The girls placed their shoes in a tiny manner.

"It's a tiny house," Weiss commented. "I read in a business magazine the other day about how a technical fellow of Trans-dimensional Research Laboratory makes six figures, and you're living in such a run down place."

"We're collectively pumping our money into local investments as much as possible," Archer replied. "Aside from that, we don't really need a big house to live in. Though I have a much bigger house back on Earth."

Diana Rose carried a plate full of food to the dining table. "Here we go," she announced. "Sushi." There was raw fishes on the platter. "Oh, just in case you're wondering, the raw fishes are perfectly safe to eat."

"Really?" Yang said skeptically.

Archer grabbed a bite, chewed through it, and swallowed it. "Traditional Japanese cuisine preserved across thousand of years into traditional Sidonian cuisine. It's very good."

"I don't like the idea of eating raw food," Ruby said.

"I don't...mind," Blake replied, even as she eyed the fishes with delight.

"In that case," Archer said. "You're free to eat the non-raw portion of it. Sasaki cooked all this. You should thank her."

"Thank you," the girls said collectively as they all grabbed a few bites.

"I didn't know that you were going to invites your friends," Archer said.

"I didn't...exactly," Blake admitted. Her bows twitched, which raised Archer's eyebrows in response.

"We were following her because we don't know what's she up to and wouldn't tell us," Ruby volunteered before the engineer can think further.

"Hiding why just make it a bigger juicier mystery," Yang concurred.

"I was dragged along," Weiss excused herself.

"Nuh-huh, you wanted to find out as well," Ruby accused.

"Did not!"

"Uh-huh."

"Girls! Why don't you introduce yourselves?" Archer interrupted. "Over a cup of tea?"

***

Ruby Rose introduced herself first, though rather shyly. Weiss tried to sell Dust right after she repeated a rehearsed performance. Yang, was well, herself. Blake, well, she told them the most bland story she could.

"I see. So all of you are currently attending a military academy where you are learning how to fight horrifying monsters of darkness as part of team RWBY," Archer recalled. "Sounds like something out of a fantasy novel."

"But it's all real!" Ruby protested.

"So is traveling across realities and meeting aliens. It's very fantastic stuff, except we're living it now, aren't we?"

"So is having your world operating without Dust. That's what somebody on Remnant might write," Blake echoed back.

"Let cut to the chase to the reason why we're here today; Blake, why are you so interested in the right revolutions on Earth? Do you have faunus friends? One of your parent?" Archer wondered.

Blake froze in her track, unsure what to say. From her right, Weiss folded her arms, pulling on her sleeves.

"Well..umm...there's the White Fang?"

"White Fang?!" Weiss interrupted. "You mean, the most evil terrorist organization on Remnant? I don't believe you support them, right?"

"No!" Bellaodonna denied. "But...they wouldn't act the way they do if.."

"How could you support them, Blake? Their slated goal is to WIPE out humanity off the face of this planet. They killed family and board members! Dad would come home angry." Weiss quieted down at the end.

"THAT wouldn't happen if people like your family and Cardin treated the Faunus so badly!" Blake angrily shouted back. "What are they supposed to do? Do nothing?"

"HEY! I am a victim! It isn't my fault those faunus, liars and thieves is what all they are, joined the White Fang!"

Blake bursted into tears as she rushed to the nearest restroom. Schnee began stomping out of the house.

"What...did just happen?" a distraught Ruby Rose wondered.

"I don't know, but I am going after Weiss, you take of Rose," Yang said quickly. "HEY Weiss, where are you going?!"

***

Blake hunched herself on the floor of the small restroom, with the door locked. She came to learn more from Archer in the hope of finding more understanding, but unfortunately her own team decided to come. What a huge mess it was.

There was several knocks on the restroom door.

"Blake? BLakkkkkeee! Can you answer me? Are you going to be alright?" Ruby Rose questioned.

"I am..." Blake choked a bit. "Fine..."

"You can use the restroom to cry for as long as you need, but if people need to use the restroom, you are going to get out, OK?" Archer said.

She didn't reply.

***

She didn't know how long she been in the restroom, but it felt long enough. She creaked the door open slightly.

Ruby Rose was staring at the restroom door, not touching her tea at all. Meanwhile, Archer stared at nothing as he poured himself another cup of tea.

The door became more wide open.

"Ah, you finally come out. Want to have some tea? Want to talk about it?"

"Where's Weiss?" Blake inquired.

"Your friend is outside with Yang," Archer answered. "We agreed for now that she won't come inside if you don't want her to, for now, and we don't have to talk about the fight if you don't want to. Though it would ruin my dinner plans for team RWBY."

Blake grabbed a cup of tea before speaking, "I don't agree with the White Fang, but I didn't know that Weiss Schnee hated faunus."

"That was a surprise to me. I assumed that all Remnans aren't racists until they are."

"Racists..."

"A form of bigotry that's kinda hard to define. Racism is a kind of social construct that exists only on Earth, but I find it easy to apply that label to people's relation to faunus. I talked to Weiss about it and I could understand where she's coming from. She spent her childhood being under attack. That's probably going to prejudiced anyone's view, even though they would be wrong to discriminate against all faunus."

"Have you ever been....prejudiced for any reason?"

Archer looked up to the celling and closed his eyes. "Probably? I am just a human being after all. It would be strange of me to not have any character flaws, or imperfection. I am not a saint or a hero. Just an engineer."

After that, no one said anything for a good while, even Ruby.

***
**Weiss Schnee**

Weiss Schnee couldn't even deal with Yang. Even she was repelled by her hatred of faunus and the White Fang. So, she sat on someone's patio, sulking a fair distance from Yang.

A shadow approached, growing larger as footstep became louder.

"There you are," a woman's voice said.

Weiss looked up. It was Diana Rose.

"What do you want?" Weiss said those words harshly.

"Just want to talk to you, kid," Rose said.

"I am not a kid."

"Brains like your don't stop developing until they're in their twenties."

"What difference does that make?"

"It means...I am willing to give you more slack than usual..."

"I didn't do anything!"

"Not in the eyes of the law or society, but something between you and Blake did happened."

"She shouldn't defend the White Fang. They're pure evil."

Rose sat down on the same patio as Weiss. "Not once did I hear Blake defend them."

"Then....why?"

"Perhaps you're playing in their hand, young lady?"

"How?"

"By making you think they're not humans at all, or subhumans, you're helping them forment a conflict between the Faunus and the so-called vanilla humans. They want nothing more than a war against all of 'humanity', right?"

"Extermination."

"And they can't do it without the support of faunus who also hate the rest of humanity. So, they would go around, attack targets to provoke them into lashing out at the faunus, driving more and more people into the hand of the White Fang."

"But how? I can't trust any of the faunus because they might go join the White Fang behind my back!"

"I didn't say it will be easy. On the contrary, it's very difficult, even for people on Earth. There's been attacks on innocent people who seemed to be related to terrorist organizations, even people who are totally unrelated to terrorists in their ethnicity. They are rare attacks, but they are reflective of people's attitudes. But you have friends, right? They know faunus that you can trust?"

"I don't know. People hated my company and family."

"I don't hate you. I barely got to know you."

**Several hours...later**

Diana and I talked to Blake and Weiss about serious matters, but we didn't totally resolve their problems. It would be too much to expect them to be OK in all of one day. But luckily we were able to resume our dinner plans thanks to some teammate reconciliation.

We even watched a civil right movement documentary that I acquired from the Sidonian archive, which got Ruby Rose squiriming at the violence inflicted on protestors.

Now, it was dinner time, with lot of servings for the girls, because we vanilla humans are not totally capable of aura stuff, much less Remnan feats, thus relegating our metabolism requirement to ultra-low relatively speaking.

Dishes began arriving from the dinning table. Diana and I got sushi, while the girls of team RWBY got bigger items with chopsticks. Meanwhile, Sasaki got a very tiny dish to compensate for the Sidonians' lack of need to ingest food on a daily basis. Diana and Sasaki then finally seated themselves.

"I am glad that nobody ran off despite the arguments that broke out between half of your teammates," I said.

"Sorry!" Ruby Rose apologized.

"We usually don't spend too much on food, but today we don't mind. It's a pleasure to have guests over," I continued. "And....enjoy!"

We dugged in for the food.

***

One by one, the girls left the house, returning to Beacon Academy where they will continue their military education in slaying monsters.

Finally, Blake turned her back to us. "Thanks," she said. "For everything."

"You're welcome," I said.

Then team RWBY left.
