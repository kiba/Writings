# **Chapter Eighteen: Policy Update**

**Professor Ozpin**
**Beacon Academy, Vale**
**July 2, 2015**

Professor Ozpin was enjoying a cup of coffee as the sun dawn. He reflected back on the negotiation that he was part of for the past three weeks. As expected, it was a throughly new experience.

Negotiation and signing went well enough, though there were surprising terms from the Sidonians.

One particular demand was immigration access for their people, including the ability to apply for citizenship in any of the four kingdom and being able to study at any of the huntsman academies. In return, they'll reciprocate. Naturally, this caused consternation amongst Remnan negotiators as they looked for nefarious and hidden motives. The Sidonian leadership explained their demand as part of the mission of their nation, to perpetuate and preserve humanity. In the end, the negotiators agreed to a small quota, which will be negotiated yearly.

Moreover, instead of demanding everything under the sun, the Sidonians remain unerringly fair, agreeing to modifications or suggesting changes to allow for expanded cultural and technological exchange, though military tech remain off-limit for the time being.

The Cylons' desires was simple, a homeland for their kind, and capital goods and services to assist creating more of them, all in exchange for technical and scientific cooperation.

The two Earthlings' demands were slightly more complex, but not really difficult to fulfill. They were only interested in safety and knowledge.

By the time the agreement were signed, there were already cooperation amongst everyone, and the Earthlings moved in with their tools into their new combined lab and machine shop.

Right before his eyes, a TDM appeared suddenly on the ground of the Beacon Academy. Two figures immediately disgorged. He could tell that it was a huntsman carrying a large package.

He expected this all morning.

"So, you're not drunk," Glynda Goodwitch stated as she watched carry a large cardboard box.

"I am not drunk," Qrow Branwen affirmed. He then immediately took out his flask, eliciting a slight growl from Goodwitch. "I am now."

Ozpin ignored that act. "So what have you got for us?"

"Something really good. I got us some communication devices that worked without the towers being present or operational. Nothing, not even the atmosphere or the thickness of walls block communication, except gravity." He then opened the box for all to see.

Inside the box was several sets of phones as well manuals and engineering books. Each phone were encased transparently, its inner working exposed for all to see.

"Interesting. What did you do for it?"

Qrow shrugged. "Nothing much. I was getting a tour around their ship, and then suddenly at the end of the tour, they gifted me those electronics. They said it was a very common piece of electronics and they weren't very assured by the towers' limitation. They want a reliable and direct line of communication."

"A portent of what to come, I supposed. If trade begins on a large scale, their phones might displace our scrolls. Though I imagined certain corporations will do everything in their power to delay such an introduction..."

"Honestly? It's worth the price. If those phones work the way they say they do, we don't have to worry about the towers being switched off at a critical moment. Though there is a limit, I am told that we still need infrastructure if we want to support anything larger."

"I want to send a few over to an engineering lab, along with the copy of the manual. The rest will be distributed to each of the four kingdom to be used in case of emergency."

"I'll get it done." Qrow put a set on Ozpin desk and then took the box and walked out.

"It looked like the aliens are really sincere about helping us," Goodwitch said.

"Because it is in their interest," Ozpin said. "It'll open up a new market and allow them to purchase more of our materials and resources."

"Do you think it's bugged?"

"Maybe. But that's why they're going to be used sparsely. I doubt we'll stop manufacturing scrolls. More likely we'll incorporate the principles of their technologies into ours. "

**Captain Kobayashi**
**Sidonia**

There was a side to her that nobody else knew as she never divulged her face or identity to anyone. Unsurprising, that meant she could shop or go anywhere, with none of them being any wiser.

The immortal had just gotten a seat at a cafe, listening to the conversations that was happening around her. To a large degree, it was about trans-dimensional travel and the world of Remnant, much of it discussed with excited and curious tones. But there are some discussion that veered toward the topic of immortality conspiracy.

Much of which would be squarely blamed on the feet of James Archer and his girlfriend. That, more than anything else alarmed her, and she was loathed to sweep him aside to put a stop to his subversive ideas, especially early in their collaboration. The man made himself too useful and indispensable.

The various methods available were not moral, and after her murders of her fellow immortals, she finally had enough. She also promised a certain someone not to do the things that she used to do. It was also too late anyway, attacking him in any way or form will draw unnecessary attention, leading to a spike of weariness and loss of group cohesion amongst Sidonia and the security force.

On the other hand, she had no intention of dying or going down quietly into the night. No way. It was not only her life she has to worry about, but her new family, and those of her friends. There wasn't a complete solution, but in time she'll come up with one, hopefully before it's too late.

Speaking of persons personally impacted when her leadership is questioned, a century old redhead just entered the cafe, her gaze directed at Kobayashi's table. It was only several footstep before she arrived at Kobayashi's table.

"How's Tanikaze-kun and Saitou-kun doing?" the redhead asked.

"Just fine."

Sasaki seated herself before ordering a drink from a waitress. "I never took you for a family woman."

"Neither did I. It was all so sudden. It turned out that no matter how immortal you are, you can still lose time. I should had done it a long time ago."

"Better late than never."

"That, and nobody's in my way. I don't have to watch my back." It was of course, a thinly veiled reference to her slaughter of the treasonous immortal council. It took time to convince Sasaki and Shinatose that she wasn't coming after them. "Say, how's Archer and Rose?"

"Oh, the same usual. Rose and I were restraint on Archer's antics. They seemed to have forgotten what I was supposed to be to them in the first place, not that I really care."

"That's good news. There's business I want to discuss, but not here. We should head upstair."

"Alright."

The two women picked up their drinks, before signaling a waitress. They then moved upstair into a private partition.

"You know, your Earth friends are militant immortalists," Kobayashi said. "They advocated curing the diseases of aging and giving anti-therapies to everyone. We have that technology, but we don't want to dispense it to anyone except the select few and to protect against population explosion."

"Because it would make our mission pointless," Sasaki parroted back. "And unofficially, it would threatened the power structure. That's why we have secret laws with severe penalties, prohibiting the spread of immortality."

"That power structure is no more, because I eliminated them all."

"Are-are you saying you want to spread the therapies to everyone else? I-I don't know what to say."

"Exactly. When I adopted Tanikaze-kun, I realized that I wanted to be a mother...It wouldn't be possible if we don't have children. Having children and being immortal can become an exclusive choice when faced with resource scarcity. Then I realized that overpopulation isn't a problem if there are worlds to settle, if we could expand infinitely through alternate realities for all of eternity. Entropy itself is defeated, not just with the hiegus particles, but with trans-dimensional travel."

"Then nobody has to die," Sasaki concluded.

"On the contrary, as long as there are threats in the multiverse, somebody might need to fight, and there's always a risk of dying in a war, but nobody will have to die simply because they grew too old."

"But then? What about us? About me? The rumor of a secret conspiracy of immortals cannot be squashed, even if everyone is offered the choice of immortality."

"I admit that is a problem, but I am not going to kill anyone."

"Oh yeah? You killed the councilmembers."

"It was necessary."

"Maybe so, but it set a precedent. Conveniently enough, the councilmembers can't be there to defend themselves either."

"Do you trust me?"

"It depends. I trusted you not to kill me and Shinatose-san. I don't trust you not to utilize underhanded methods against opponents of your regime."

"You have no objection to spreading the therapies."

"None at all. I would be delighted not to see old friends die. You done us a favor for getting rid of the council. Is that all you wanted to discuss?"

"Yes."

"Good day to you, Captain."

**James Archer**

It felt really good to be out in the open and not have to worry about the laws and government G-men. Not only that, I was given a generous salary by the four kingdoms, but also a much bigger space to work within, even the title 'Director' of the Trans-dimensional Research Labaratory.
