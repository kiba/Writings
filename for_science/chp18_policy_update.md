# **Chapter Eighteen: Policy Update**

**Professor Ozpin**
**July 2, 2015**

Professor Ozpin was enjoying a cup of coffee as the sun dawn. He reflected back on the negotiation that he was part of for the past three weeks. As expected, it was a throughly new experience.

Negotiation and signing went well enough, though there were surprising terms from the Sidonians.

One particular demand was immigration access for their people, including the ability to apply for citizenship in any of the four kingdom and being able to study at any of the huntsman academies. In return, they'll reciprocate. Naturally, this caused consternation amongst Remnan negotiators as they looked for nefarious and hidden motives. The Sidonian leadership explained their demand as part of the mission of their nation, to perpetuate and preserve humanity. In the end, the negotiators agreed to a small quota, which will be negotiated yearly.

Moreover, instead of demanding everything under the sun, the Sidonians remain unerringly fair, agreeing to modifications or suggesting changes to allow for expanded cultural and technological exchange, though military tech remain off-limit for the time being.

The Cylons' desires was simple, a homeland for their kind, and capital goods and services to assist creating more of them, all in exchange for technical and scientific cooperation.

The two Earthlings' demands were slightly more complex, but not really difficult to fulfill. They were only interested in safety and knowledge.

By the time the agreement were signed, there were already cooperation amongst everyone, and the Earthlings moved in with their tools into their new combined lab and machine shop.

Right before his eyes, a TDM appeared suddenly on the ground of the Beacon Academy. Two figures immediately disgorged. He could tell that it was a huntsman carrying a large package.

He expected this all morning.

"So, you're not drunk," Glynda Goodwitch stated as she watched carry a large cardboard box.

"I am not drunk," Qrow Branwen affirmed. He then immediately took out his flask, eliciting a slight growl from Goodwitch. "I am now."

Ozpin ignored that act. "So what have you got for us?"

"Something really good. I got us some communication devices that worked without the towers being present or operational. Nothing, not even the atmosphere or the thickness of walls block communication, except gravity." He then opened the box for all to see.

Inside the box was several sets of phones as well manuals and engineering books. Each phone were encased transparently, its inner working exposed for all to see.

"Interesting. What did you do for it?"

Qrow shrugged. "Nothing much. I was getting a tour around their ship, and then suddenly at the end of the tour, they gifted me those electronics. They said it was a very common piece of electronics and they weren't very assured by the towers' limitation. They want a reliable and direct line of communication."

"A portent of what to come, I supposed. If trade begins on a large scale, their phones might displace our scrolls. Though I imagined certain corporations will do everything in their power to delay such an introduction..."

"Honestly? It's worth the price. If those phones work the way they say they do, we don't have to worry about the towers being switched off at a critical moment. Though there is a limit, I am told that we still need infrastructure if we want to support anything larger."

"I want to send a few over to an engineering lab, along with the copy of the manual. The rest will be distributed to each of the four kingdom to be used in case of emergency."

"I'll get it done." Qrow put a set on Ozpin desk and then took the box and walked out.

"It looked like the aliens are really sincere about helping us," Goodwitch said.

"Because it is in their interest," Ozpin said. "It'll open up a new market and allow them to purchase more of our materials and resources."

"Do you think it's bugged?"

"Maybe. But that's why they're going to be used sparsely. I doubt we'll stop manufacturing scrolls. More likely we'll incorporate the principles of their technologies into ours. "
