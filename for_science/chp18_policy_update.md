# **Chapter Eighteen: Policy Update**

**Professor Ozpin**
**Beacon Academy, Vale**
**July 2, 2015**

Professor Ozpin was enjoying a cup of coffee as the sun dawn. He reflected back on the negotiation that he was part of for the past three weeks. As expected, it was a throughly new experience.

Negotiation and signing went well enough, though there were surprising terms from the Sidonians.

One particular demand was immigration access for their people, including the ability to apply for citizenship in any of the four kingdom, including the possibility of attending any huntsmen academies. In return, they'll reciprocate. Naturally, this caused consternation amongst Remnan negotiators as they looked for nefarious and hidden motives. The Sidonian leadership explained their demand as part of the mission of their nation, to perpetuate and preserve humanity across the stars. In the end, the negotiators agreed to a small quota, which will be negotiated yearly.

Moreover, instead of demanding everything under the sun, the Sidonians remain unerringly fair, agreeing to modifications or suggesting changes to allow for expanded cultural and technological exchange, though military tech remained off-limit for the time being.

The Cylons' desires was simple, a homeland for their kind, and capital goods and services to assist creating more of them, all in exchange for technical and scientific cooperation.

The two Earthlings' demands were slightly more complex, but not really difficult to fulfill. They were only interested in safety and knowledge.

By the time the agreement were signed, there were already cooperation amongst everyone, and the Earthlings moved in with their tools into their new combined lab and machine shop.

Right before his eyes, a TDM appeared suddenly on the ground of the Beacon Academy. A figure immediately disgorged. He could tell that it was a huntsman carrying a large package.

He expected this all morning.

"So, you're not drunk," Glynda Goodwitch stated as she watched carry a large cardboard box.

"I am not drunk," Qrow Branwen affirmed. He then immediately took out his flask, eliciting a slight growl from Goodwitch. "I am now."

Ozpin ignored that act. "So what have you got for us?"

"Something really good. I got us some communication devices that worked without the towers being present or operational. Nothing, not even the atmosphere or the thickness of walls can block communication, except gravity." He then opened the box for all to see.

Inside the box was several sets of phones as well manuals and engineering books. Each phone were encased transparently, its inner working exposed for all to see.

"Interesting. What did you do for it?"

Qrow shrugged. "Nothing much. I was getting a tour around their city-ship, and then at the end of the tour, they gifted me those electronics, which they said everyone in Sidonia carried one. They explained that they weren't very assured by the towers' limitation. They wanted to ensure a reliable and direct line of communication."

"A portent of what to come, I supposed. If trade begins on a large scale, their phones might displace our scrolls. Though I imagined certain corporations will do everything in their power to delay such an introduction..."

"Honestly? It's worth the price. If those phones work the way they say they do, we don't have to worry about the towers being switched off at a critical moment. The only other caveat is that we still need to build infrastructures to support large scale communications."

"I want to send a few over to an engineering lab, along with the copy of the manual. The rest will be distributed to each of the four kingdom to be used in case of emergency."

"I'll get it done." Qrow put a set on Ozpin desk and then took the box and walked out.

"It looked like the aliens are really sincere about helping us," Goodwitch said.

"Because it is probably in their interest," Ozpin said. "It'll open up a new market and allow them to purchase more of our materials and resources, especially dust."

"Do you think it's bugged?"

"Maybe. But that's why they're going to be used sparsely. I doubt we'll stop manufacturing scrolls. More likely we'll incorporate the principles of their technologies into ours. "

**Captain Kobayashi**
**Sidonia**

There was a side to her that few knew as she never divulged her face or identity to the public at large. Unsurprising, that meant she could shop or go anywhere, with none of them being any wiser.

The immortal had just gotten a seat at a cafe, listening to the conversations that was happening around her. To a large degree, it was about trans-dimensional travel and the world of Remnant, much of it discussed with excited and curious tones. But there are some discussion that veered toward the topic of the immortal conspiracy.

Much of the rumors can be squarely blamed on the feet of James Archer and his girlfriend. That, more than anything else alarmed her, and she was loathed to sweep him aside to put a stop to his subversive ideas, especially when the man made himself so useful and invaluable in building on his research.

The various methods available she contemplated for eliminating or discrediting him were not moral, and after her murders of her fellow immortals, she finally had enough. She also promised a certain someone not to do the things that she used to do. It was also too late anyway as attacking him in any way or form will draw unnecessary attention, leading to a spike of weariness and the loss of group cohesion amongst Sidonia and the security force.

On the other hand, she had no intention of dying or going down quietly into the night. No way. It was not only her life she has to worry about, but her new family, and those of her friends. There wasn't a complete solution, but in time she'll come up with one, hopefully before it's too late.

Speaking of persons personally impacted when her leadership is questioned, a century old redhead just entered the cafe, her gaze directed at Kobayashi's table. It was only several footstep before she arrived at Kobayashi's table.

"How's Tanikaze-kun and Saitou-kun doing?" the redhead asked.

"Just fine."

Sasaki seated herself before ordering a drink from a waitress. "I never took you for a family woman."

"Neither did I. It was all so sudden. It turned out that no matter how immortal you are, time lost is still forever lost. I should had done it a long time ago."

"Better late than never."

"That, and nobody's in my way. I don't have to watch my back." It was of course, a thinly veiled reference to her slaughter of the treasonous immortal council. It took time to convince Sasaki and Shinatose that she wasn't coming after them. "Say, how's Archer-san and Rose-san?"

"Oh, the same usual. Rose-san and I made sure that Archer-kundidn't get into trouble. They seemed to have forgotten what I was supposed to be to them in the first place, not that I really care."

"That's good news. There's business I want to discuss, but not here. We should head upstair."

"Alright."

The two women picked up their drinks, before signaling a waitress. They then moved upstair into a private partition.

"You know, your Earth friends are militant immortalists," Kobayashi said. "They advocated curing the diseases of aging and giving anti-therapies to everyone. We have that technology for a long time, but we don't want to dispense it to anyone except the select few and to protect against population explosion."

"Because it would make our mission pointless," Sasaki parroted back. "And unofficially, it would threatened the power structure. That's why we have secret laws with severe penalties, prohibiting the spread of immortality."

"That power structure is no more, because I eliminated them all."

"Are-are you saying you want to spread the therapies to everyone else? I-I don't know what to say."

"Exactly. When I adopted Tanikaze-kun, I realized that I wanted to be a mother...It wouldn't be possible if we don't have children. Having children and being immortal can become exclusive choices when faced with resource scarcity, which was inevitable with population growth. Then I realized that overpopulation isn't a problem if there are worlds to settle, if we could just expand infinitely through alternate realities for all of eternity."

"Then nobody has to die," Sasaki concluded.

"On the contrary, as long as there are threats in the multiverse, somebody might need to fight, and there's always a risk of dying in a war, but nobody will have to die simply because they grew too old."

"But then? What about us? About me? The rumor of a secret conspiracy of immortals cannot be squashed, even if everyone is offered the choice of immortality."

"I admit that is a problem, but I am not going to kill anyone."

"Oh yeah? You killed almost all of the immortal committee right in the chamber."

"It was necessary."

"Maybe so, but it set a precedent. Conveniently enough, the councilmembers can't be there to defend themselves either."

"Do you trust me?"

"It depends. I trusted you not to kill me and Shinatose-san. I don't trust you not to utilize underhanded methods against opponents of your regime. "

"You have no objection to spreading the therapies?"

"None at all. I rather not see old friends die. I think you done us a favor for getting rid of the council. Is that all you wanted to discuss?"

"Yes."

"Good day to you, Captain."

**James Archer**

It felt really good to be out in the open and not have to worry about the laws and government G-men. Not only that, I was given a generous salary by the four kingdoms, but also a much bigger space to work with, even the title 'fellow' for the Trans-dimensional Research Laboratory. Thank god that they didn't make me director. I hate the idea of being a politician or a bureaucrat.

It was of course, not without obligations. Everything that the rsearch lab did or will do is 'open source' and freely available for the public at large.

"Hello!" I greeted the researchers walking in. Today was just getting started, and already there was a new batch of faces that I did not recognize.

I hummed to myself as I approached my corner of the lab, full of stuff that I 'invented' and was working toward to reverse engineering, which the Sidonians called 'tinkertech.' I thought it was a sucky name, but it stuck. It was a term for any Rube Golderg-equse technological artifact that nonetheless accomplish something useful.

On a table laid the prototype Mark I shield generator, a device that unsurprisingly generated force field, much like the Remnan's aura shield, but vastly inferior. It looked like a gnarly mess, but at least it was engineered correctly, with no unnecessary complexity that was the defining characteristic of tinkertech.

I turned on the device, making it generating a forcefield, but also making it consume energy at a prodigious rate.

A forcefield bubble appeared with almost no sound at all, although the device that generated it was whirling rather loudly.

I took out a pencil and pushed it lightly against the forcefield. Then I pushed harder, and the shield penetrated the forcefield with a little pop.

It was a groundbreaking prototype to be sure, but it wasn't just very practical yet. It used a lot of energy to generate a pathetic field.

"Requesting Archer immediately to the director's office," the public announcement speaker said. " Requesting Archer immediately to the director's office."

Damn! I forgot. I was given freedom to pursue research however I felt like, but it doesn't mean that there are no annoying bureaucracy to contend with.

So, I turned off the shield generator and headed for the director's office.

***

I found myself in a room with the director, a Doctor Polenda, which I had only known through video conferences and a whole lot of reading. He has an impressive resume who worked largely for the massive Atlasian industrial research complex, who practically demanded his job. He got it.

"You must be James Archer that I keep hearing about," the portly man. "Pardon me for not being there at the opening ceremony, but you must understand that my former boss tried to stall me one last time."

"I take it that it didn't work," I said.

"No it didn't. Years of working for the military had predisposed them to taking me far too much for granted.  Now, apart from the foreigners, I am the only big name in town. Have you taken a look at the researchers who were hired?"

"No I didn't."

"If you did, our lab didn't get the top researchers from all four corners of the globe. Now, the kingdoms wouldn't go so far as to sabotage the collaborative institute with subpar researchers. They were respectable, at the very least. "

"I didn't know. I was too far interested in working."

"I empathize with your desire to just do interesting work, but politics is the fact of life. Even now, the Atlasian military still got a stranglehold on me, because of what I accomplished...Though it was partly that they still need me to do work for them."

"And?"

"Politics can't be ignored! If we want top-notch researchers, we'll have to utilize those researchers to our maximum benefit. That means management."

"Oh god, no."

"Please hear me out, Mr. Archer. Regardless of what you and I believed about academic freedom, our funding came from the taxpayers of the four kingdom, and with tax money, come politics, whether we like it or not. We must deliver something that their eyes can feast on. Only then would they leave us alone. That means public relation campaign, managing researchers, and other boring but essential tasks for survival. Otherwise, you'll have to pack up and leave for other pasture, such as working under solely the Sidonians."

"But I suck at management."

"I know that you managed projects for the Sidonians."

"But..."

"If you don't want to be a manager, I'll find something else that you're good at. If you refuse to choose anything, I will assign a duty for you. No researchers here will sacrifice nothing."
