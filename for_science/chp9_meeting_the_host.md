# **Chapter Nine: Meeting the Host**

**James Archer**

It was a good thing that we had the barf bags handy. Predictably, we barfed from the side effect of the jump drive. It turned out that the various upgrades to the trans-dimensional machine was only a marginal improvement in term of reducing nausea.

In short order, an unpleasant smell filled the brown bags. Since, we were feeling nauseous, it was rather difficult to focus on the task of sealing those bags inside a plastic container.

We didn't know how long, but lights started shining into the one window we installed on this machine.

Needless to say. It didn't look good. There were men outside in white clothes and they were all masked, giving off a sinister vibe.

"Intruders, get out of the vehicle and put your hands up in the air," one of them shouted in Sidonian Japanese.

Neither of us understood what they were saying. It was just moonspeech to us.

I sighed in annoyance at having to learn yet another language.

"We should get out," she said. "And make no sudden movement."

I nodded in agreement.

I opened the door and walked out slowly with my hands up in the air, fighting against my tiredness and desire for a quick nap.

"Who are you? State your business!" the man to the side of me said.

"I don't understand," I responded.

Slowly, my lover came outside. She too, held her hands up.

"They're not Sidonians," one of them said.

"Quiet," the commander in charge warned his subordinate.

Suddenly, I drifted into unconsciousness and fell down to the floor, my face striking the metallic floor quite hard.

**Diana Rose**

Diana groaned from the hit of tranquilizer darts aimed at her face, which had dosed her to sleep.

She stirred from her sleep, opening up her eyes to a bland metal ceiling with built-in lighting fixture.

"Where the hell am I?" she said, not quite remembering the event that led her to this state and place.

She sat up, taking in the view of her surrounding.

It was a room, of a sort. There were no visible doors, actually, and only the barest of accommodations. Almost everything seemed to be made of stainless steel, with the least amount visible weldings, rivets, or cuts they can get away with.

There was a sink with a mirror, toilet, a table and a chair, a flat top that obviously meant to be a bed. They all were designed to be unyankable, not without significant force.

And it was extremely clean with absolutely no dust as far as the eye can see. There was no evidence that anybody ever lived here.

It was absolutely clear to her that she was here not as a guest, but a prisoner. Possibly in a room for a prisoner that someone would want to throw away the key forever for.

But who?

"Oh!" she said, remembering what just had happen. "Fuck!"

What the hell she had gotten herself in?

In hindsight, doing trans-dimensional travel with her significant other will get her into significant trouble. But at the same time, she loved the idiot too much not to abandon him.

She was scared for his life, especially against the forces that had turned her boyfriend's life upside down.

Diana could had gotten help, but like Delta, she was afraid of the consequence. But on the other hand, so long as they keep this thing a secret, he wouldn't get any help from anybody. So the status quo was preserved.

And now, she was paying the consequence of doing nothing, and to travel blindly. She should had thought more than preparing for travel rather than trusting that everything was going to be alright somehow.

Clearly, not everything was alright.

Without any warning, a gap in the wall was created, leading to a hallway outside. A person was already present in that hallway.

This person and one more of the masked security agents walked inside.

"We are sorry for this accommodation," a security agent said in accented English, with the voice of a female. "You must understand, the area you entered in was restricted to anybody without the proper security clearance. Now, if you follow us, you will receive a new accommodation that should be more amicable to you, but you will still be restricted in your freedom of movement until we can verify your story."

"Where's my boyfriend?" she almost shouted the question.

"If you cooperate with us, you will see him," the male security agent said. "Please don't make it more difficult than it needed to be."

Diana wasn't going to lash out. As far as she was concerned, she was at their absolute mercy. No way in hell that she was going to escape this place, whatever this place was. This was not a movie, or a manga, or some novel. This was real life, however surreal it had become.

"Alright, I'll cooperate, for now," Diana said.

"Thank you. Please follow me, miss," the masked female figure said.

As the agent moved, Rose followed her lead.

Meanwhile, the male followed behind.

Immediately, she noticed the sword scabbard and gun hostler on the person she's following. There was no escaping this. She would most definitely be dead or worse if she tried anything.

Time passed as she went up in an elevator with them, to god knows where. But it felt like an eternity.

Eventually, the wayward traveler and her escorted arrived at a more inviting abode, complete with actual bedsheet, shelves, pillows, cup ramen, and other creature comforts, including an actual restroom. However, nowhere had she gone outside the whole time.

And she had kept track the entire time, estimating the distance travel, and it wasn't inconsiderable. Somewhere around three kilometers.

This place was big. Very big.

"What is your name miss?" the female agent asked.

"Diana. Diana Rose," the mechanical engineer answered.

"Diana is your personal name and Rose is your family name?"

"Yes. Rose is my last name, and Diana is my first name."

"Well, then, Miss Rose, or Rose-san in our culture, someone will be there shortly to ask you questions. Answer the question truthfully, and if it all goes well, you'll get to see your loved one."

"Got it."

"We're pleased that you understand. We'll be right outside if you need us."

The two security agents went outside.

Instead of being trapped in an uninviting place, Diana was now trapped in what resembled an apartment, sans electronics of any kind.

Great, just great.

Uncertainly inevitably continued to occupy her mind.

What were they're doing to her boyfriend? Is he OK? What about the machine? Are they planning something nefarious? Why are the security agents wearing ivory masks? If anything, it made them even more sinister, as opposed to being more welcoming.

But as she waited, there were no answers forthcoming.

**Captain Kobayashi**

Thousand of years ago, a race of aliens known only as the [I]Gauna[/I], split the Earth in half. Since then, humanity left the solar system in massive arkships designed to carry them across the void to other solar systems, in the hope of outrunning the Gauna and finding a new home amongst the stars.

But Sidonia was now the only known human settlement still standing in the known universe, and she may be the last bastion of humanity.

But today, Captain Kobayashi, commander and leader of the ship, was confronted by two anomalous individuals, seemly from the archaic early twenty-first century. At first, she held hope that they were from another seedship.

However, interrogation of the individual named James Archer failed to reveal the location of another seedship. Instead, he may be a bona-fide twenty-first century human, hailing from an old empire named the United States of America. The other option was insanity.

He emphatically denied the use of time travel, saying that it violated causality, though he affirmed trans-dimensional travel as the method of travel. That wasn't prohibited by the law of physics as anybody knew, but there was no theories on how to travel between realities.

Currently, the captain was monitoring an interrogation of this gentleman's alleged girlfriend, Diana Rose, who was answering questions in a bugged abode. It took a short while to prepare, but the apartment was now bugged with all sort of equipment to record the interaction for Sidonia's knowledge. Normally, that wasn't done except in a criminal investigation, but this was simply unprecedented. There had never been any human aliens to spy on, until now. Intelligence work and espionage as an enterprise had disappeared since the destruction of the solar system, such notions only remaining alive in stories and historical records, until now.

The interview continued smoothly so far, and there were little to no inconsistency in the female's answer.

"Fascinating," the captain said. "Don't you think?" She asked her assistant and confidant, the cyborg, Ochiai.

"Yes. It appeared that they were very much like our ancestors, in what recording and anthropological knowledge we have left of the ancient United States."

"I am more interested in this trans-dimensional travel capability than examining the progenitor members of ancient Earth civilization, fascinating as they are. We must have it." she said it with hunger. Left unsaid was if this was a trick or a prelude to an invasion, or something worse.

But if they were able to fake it that well, then there may be absolutely no hope for Sidonia in term of survival. One do not plan for a sudden blackhole singularity appearing inside of the arkship at all. An instant death meant that no plan will achieve any sort of success.

"If we can adapt the technology to our purpose, we may be able to find a safe haven for Sidonian," Ochiai deduced.

"Yes. A safe haven should anything went wrong, and a new colony. We will accomplish the goal and purpose of this arkship, though in a way that would be unimaginable to the founder of this ship."

If that was the new destiny, she would take it, regardless of the actual consequence, because it would ensure humanity's survival.

"Though, the survival of the human race was never really in doubt now that I think about it," Kobayashi remarked.

"If this turned out to be the real deal, then it is proof of the multiverse," Ochiai said. "But our dream and wishes are still the same. We are still working to preserve our heritage and our civilization, not anybody else."

"Indeed."

**James Archer**

Once again, I had no idea of where I am, who they are, or what year it was, if it was even applicable.

I came across a Japanese society, or something resembling one. At least, I am fairly sure that it was.

And I am walking with my escorts to my temporary housing, they said. But I wasn't exactly trusting of them, even if their actions are pretty damn understandable. Can't I go somewhere nice instead?

No, I had to waltz into the territory of nations and powers I do not even understand. First, killer bots, now scary masked ninjas.

First, they had compounded my machine, probably studying it with their brand of mad scientists and engineers. Next, they 'interviewed' me to death, in which I spoke almost anything and everything, without any concern for secrecy. First, it was in incomprehensible Japanese, then broken English, and finally native English.

No god damn handy universal translator.

I shouldn't done what I did. I may just jeopardized the safety of my Cylon helper and the lives of my fellow Earthlings in the process.

For all I know, they could be an xenophobic people looking for their next conquest. That didn't seem to be the case at all, at least so far.

Anyway, it was god damn good thing that they knew English and the fact that I am American, though most references were beyond me. With the information that they received from me, they were able to confirm that I was really from the twenty-first century.

We stopped.

Rapid sounds of Japanese were exchanged between the four individuals. Finally, the door opened up to reveal my girlfriend.

"Your girlfriend," one of them announced.

Diana rushed out and hugged me.

**Captain Kobayashi**

"Well? Let see what you have to say, Chief Sasaki," Kobayashi said.

The trio of females in this meeting were without the masks. The other two women both knew each other for hundred of years. But to an Earthling, they looked far too young to be the senior leadership of this arkship.

On the right of Kobayashi facing her was the chief of engineering, Sasaki, the other woman on the left was Doctor Yure Shinatose, chief of genetic engineering and medicine.

"The trans-dimensional machine, the parts that I can examine at least, were very crude," Sasaki began bluntly. "There's not much to say other than that there were effort to build a self-contained vessel for survival in dangerous environmental condition. Everything else was early twenty-first century technologies as far as we can examine. Their phones and tablets matched up our historical record perfectly to a 't', all the way down to the micrometer."

"So, we're dealing with twenty-first century humans after all."

"Based on the evidence shown to me, yes."

"And Doctor Sinatose?"

"Ah. I sequenced their genome, and using the databank, we were able to trace it all the way back to the early 21st century. As expected, there's imperfection and bugs in their genome. In particular, patient James Archer is expected to die of skin cancer in about thirty years, give or take a few years. However, the redhead natural-born, Diana Rose, is expected to live to her eighties, if there's no accident. My group detected no artificial DNA sequences in both of them, or any other bioengineering modification, not even Higg photosynthesis which had been made standard for the entire Sidonian population. They're both one hundred percent natural-born. I would recommend immediate gene therapy to remove most if not all gene-related health problems exhibited by both."

"Spoken like a true medical doctor, Shinatose, but I think you're forgetting something."

"Excuse me?"

"They're not Sidonians."

"I don't see how that's relevant."

"It is a bargaining chip, and that's all I cared about. If we expect to acquire their trans-dimensional travel technology and gain their cooperation, then we need a strong hand."
