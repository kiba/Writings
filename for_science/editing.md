This is a list of changes that should be made to the For Science! multicross story.

**#1 (chapter 1):** First chapter should be about James Archer's life story and his thinker abilities. Should be less abrupt. He should be more willing to jump into the unknown.

**#2 (chapter 2-7):** Expand the entire Cylon underground arc. Add a mini-plot tension.
