# **Chapter Twenty-four: Reckoning**

**Captain Kobayashi**

Months had passed, and yet she already found herself in an unenviable position. Kobayashi watched on as her family ate dinner. Her adopted son's eyes were directed at the television, absorbing information about the world that he's still very much learning. Saitou looked at nothing in particular, just bringing food into his mouth.

Sometime they talked during dinners, sometime they don't.

Frequently, Kobayashi didn't eat, as her dietary needs were reduced.

Dinners were nice, relaxing.

Unfortunately, that will soon come to an end. This dinner, an activity she came so much to value, may be the family's last.

Political realities demanded it. Her duties to her people demanded it.

Saitou glanced expectantly at Kobayashi, waiting for her to do her job.

"Nagate?" Kobayashi said.

"Yes, grandma?" the boy responded.

"All of us need to have a very important talk about what's going to happen to us over the next few days."

There she said it. It was like swallowing poison.

"OK."

**October 10, 2015**

Kobayashi overlooked a TDM that was being prepped for departure to Earth. If she was going to walk into parliament and reveal her face to the public at large, she needed to be assured of her son's safety.

"You know, I never thought I see the day when I stopped wearing the life support suit," Lala Hiyama said. She wasn't dressed in the traditional Sidonian uniform, but instead, twenty-first century clothing.

"To be honest, I was never crazy on this whole bear suit idea. Well, you asked, and Ochiai answered."

"I wished...Ochiai didn't go crazy. Ochiai today, he's not...him. He's not the Ochiai I know. He's someone else."

"I know. That's what we have to live with. All those mistakes, we can't undo."

Hiyama nodded. They stood together for a while, before Hiyama left to prepare for departure.

Only several minutes later, it was time. Hiyama linked her hands with Nagate, before climbing onto the TDM.

Finally, they disappeared into thin air.

Thirty minutes later, the TDM returned safely, empty of its human passengers. The records were scrubbed.

It was entirely up to Lala Hiyama to make it work. Luckily, she has been studying Earth customs and languages, and careful preparation had been made to insert Lala Hiyama's cover existence into the bureaucracy of Japan. It wasn't easy, and only time will tell if it works.

Hopefully, it won't be long before Tanikaze and Hiyama were back on Sidonia.

The safety of her family guaranteed for the moment, Kobayashi steeled herself for the upcoming task, ushering chaos into Sidonia before it's too late.

**Hours later**
**Cindy Blue**

The totally bogus rumors of the Sidonians never having any culture can't scarcely be further away from the truth, especially when correspondent Cindy Blue swallowed her first sushi in a lively and beautiful restaurant in front of the camera crew for the Vales News Network.

Surrounding her was a whole bunch of same-face in their characteristic uniform intently watching her. The Vale News crew were an obvious aberration in the order of things, standing out not only with camera equipment, but also with more variation of appearances through both fashion, body type, and colors. Of Last not lest, they were also foreigners in a very strange and small world.

Blue chewed through her first sushi, trying to get a deep impression of the taste, before swallowing. It was a new...experience.

"So how was it?"

She nodded. "It's good. I am not sure how to describe it? I am not a food critic."

Cheers and whistles followed. It's obvious that that the Sidonians took pride in their culture, and they should. Never let any Remnan bigots tells them otherwise!

Her previous experience already told them everything she knew. They were not totalitarians as Archer put it.

"Turn on to the news network! There's something happening in the parliament building!" someone shouted.

She did not understood what that someone say, but her gaze were directed to where the television was located in the restaurant.

The screen flickered to a channel, showing the captain taking off her mask to reveal a beautiful woman's face. This was before a sword laid on the table. Murmurs erupted as chaos broke out on television. Incessant shouting and conversations continued as Blue tried to make sense of the context.

No captain had ever revealed their face to the public before...

"Cindy? This is really important," one of the camerman said.

"Oh, right. Let get started then." She postured herself before a rolling camera before launching herself into the performance. "This is Cindy Blue of the Vales News Network. There's something happening in the Sidonian Diet, the primary lawmaking body of the colony..."

She continued reporting as best as she can, trying to inform viewers about something she barely understand herself.

**Kobayashi**

She already made sure to schedule the meeting entirely in advanced, after working out the details of hiding Nagate Tanikaze from the ravage and chaos of what was about to happen.

Nonetheless, Kobayashi felt a strong resistance, as she walked past the entrance into the assembly. Guards were on her side, everyone in their seats. They knew nothing. Very few mortals do.

The speaker began formal initialization of the meeting before letting Kobayashi set the stage.

She exhaled sharply as she looked upon her people, representatives elected by the people themselves.

*This is it*, she thought to herself. *No turning back now.*

"Many of you were wondering why you had been called forth to this meeting. I will tell you right now. Months had passed since two of our ancestors, perhaps from a different time, had shown up. We discovered a new world, and a way back to our ancestral home, new scientific fields and technologies. But it also unleashed a torrent of ideas, some criticism and commentary on our society and how we govern ourselves. One that they remarked most often is the use of masks for the highest level of leadership, a position that is unelected."




As the Sidonian Diet were thrown into parliament, she found herself breathing hard while trying to keep calm. Every part of her were repulsed by her own recklessness. She had just unmasked herself to the public, and revealed herself to be an immortal, and now she felt completely safe, at the mercy of potentially very angry Sidonians. It was at this point that political violence became a very real possibility.

But it was also necessary. Sidonia was her home, her life, and her family as much as Nagate and Hiroki were. Escape wasn't an option at all. She must held faith in her people and herself to overcome this.

"Order! Order!" the Speaker of the House commanded. The representatives quickly quieted down. "Captain Kobayashi, can you please verify your identity cryptographically to prove that you are not an imposter."

"I will," she answered.

It didn't take long to input her genetic identity and her public key, and for the verification to complete.

"Very good. I will assume for the time being that we aren't being taken for fools. But, Captain, why now? How are you able to be immortal?"

Kobayashi sighed a deep breath before talking. "For your first question, it is largely a question of 'when'. The arrival of the trans-dimensional traveler introduced new thought process and ideas, going around our blind spot. Eventually, sooner or later, this will result in a constitutional crisis, possibly at a bad time. Worse case scenario? We might lose our disunity, even fracturing. Better we deal with it now, rather than later."

Once again, the parliament broke into confused arguments.

"ORDER! ORDER!" the speaker yelled.

This was going to be a long day.

**Nagai Juri**
**Conference Room, Sidonia**

In a conference room, members of a fraction gathered.

Representative Nagai Juri was always suspicious of the captain. She couldn't help but feel that mask was trying to hide something. It turned out that she was right after all, but that wasn't all that she hoped or wished for.

It would be nice if the conspiracy theories that filled the brains of the deluded were wrong.

"Political assassination, illegal genetic engineering and cloning, immortality! All behind our back!" an older representative, Seki Kyuwa crowed. "How far? How deep?!"

He wildly eyed the people around him. "Some of you could be immortals..."

She put her hand up, signaling for everyone to shut up. "Representative Sako Shiro, I would like you to refrain from spreading paranoia and fear among our elected officials here. We must have faith in the laws and the democratic process even if our captain have subverted the process for hundred of years."

"That's what they want [i]you to say[/i]. All reasonable sounding, but it's a mind control trick! I know it! I opposed the captain all my life. I know all her tricks!" Shiro argued back.

Juri faceplammed, wondering if Shiro was actually an agent of Kobayashi instead.

She grinned silently to herself. If Kobayashi was behind this, there was no possibility of victory after all. It's all an illusion. A wide pervading conspiracy that one can predict and know about in advanced yet cannot do anything about until now? That's absolutely laughable.

**October 13, 2016**

Juri stared across the parliament against the opposition leader, member of the pro-Kobayashi fraction.

Despite the captain's confession of her crimes, which she had certified as not under duress, the pro-Kobayashi fraction didn't shrink as fast as she hoped.

No, they were stubborn in their support for the captain, throwing every wrench into any proceeding that they can, persuading people on the fence to support their cause. Why? Just why? The immortals had shamed the name of Sidonia through their illegal activities and social manipulation. If anything, they should be thrown out of the airlock, every single one of them, even the alleged 'hero' Hiroki Saitou. That wasn't likely to happen. Sidonia was too civilized to allow that kind of barbaric things to happen.

"All those who favored the impeachment of Kobayashi and other immortal officers of Sidonia?"

People pressed their button.

The votes were instantaneously tallied after everyone finished. Fifty-three percent voted 'yes'.

She smiled. Yes, this was a victory. Already, she could see the impassive leader's face frown slightly.
