# **Chapter Twenty-four: Reckoning**

**Sidonia**

I stressed out immediately the moment we arrived back on Sidonia. I can already see some very serious grim looking men with the character 'MP' stenciled on their helmet. They were the military police.

We stepped out, still in our swimsuit.

"Miss Sasaki? Will you please come with us to the police station?" a man in suit said. I sworn under my breath.

"See ya later," Sasaki said casually even as she was led away by military police at both of her side.

Just like that, Sasaki was gone.

"God damn it1" I said out loud, frustrated at not being able to help, and worried about the whole damn thing collapsing like a house of cards.

"We still have to unpack," Diana noted.

"Well, it will keep us busy and not thinking too hard about this situation....I guess."

**Hours ago...**
**Cindy Blue**

The rumors of the Sidonians never having any culture can't scarcely be further away from the truth, especially when correspondent Cindy Blue swallowed her first sushi in a lively and beautiful restaurant in front of the camera crew for the Vales News Network.

Surrounding her was a whole bunch of same-face in their characteristic uniform intently watching her. The Vale News crew were an obvious aberration in the order of things, standing out not only with camera equipment, but also with more variation of appearances through both fashion, body type, and colors. Of Last not lest, they were also foreigners in a very strange and small world.

Blue chewed through her first sushi, trying to get a deep impression of the taste, before swallowing. It was a new...experience.

"So how was it?"

She nodded. "It's good. I am not sure how to describe it? I am not a food critic."

Cheers and whistles followed. It's obvious that that the Sidonians took pride in their culture, and they should. Never let any Remnan bigots tells them otherwise!

Her previous experience already told them everything she knew. They were not totalitarians as Archer put it.

"Turn on to the news network! There's something happening in the parliament building!" someone shouted.

She did not understood what that someone say, but her gaze were directed to where the television was located in the restaurant.

The screen flickered to a channel, showing the captain taking off her mask to reveal a beautiful woman's face. This was before a sword laid on the table. Murmurs erupted as chaos broke out on television. Incessant shouting and conversations continued as Blue tried to make sense of the context.

No captain had ever revealed their face to the public before...

"Cindy? This is really important," one of the camerman said.

"Oh, right. Let get started then." She postured herself before a rolling camera before launching herself into the performance. "This is Cindy Blue of the Vales News Network. There's something happening in the Sidonian Diet, the primary lawmaking body of the colony..."

She continued reporting as best as she can, trying to inform viewers about something she barely understand herself.

**Captain Kobayashi**

As the Sidonian Diet were thrown into parliament, she found herself breathing hard while trying to keep calm. Every part of her were repulsed by her own recklessness. She had just unmasked herself to the public, and revealed herself to be an immortal, and now she felt completely safe, at the mercy of potentially very angry Sidonians. It was at this point that political violence became a very real possibility.

But it was also necessary. Sidonia was her home, her life, and her family as much as Nagate and Hiroki were. Escape wasn't an option at all. She must held faith in her people and herself to overcome this.

"Order! Order!" the Speaker of the House commanded. The representatives quickly quieted down. "Captain Kobayashi, can you please verify your identity cryptographically to prove that you are not an imposter."

"I will," she answered.

It didn't take long to input her genetic identity and her public key, and for the verification to complete.

"Very good. I will assume for the time being that we aren't being taken for fools. But, Captain, why now? How are you able to be immortal?"

Kobayashi sighed a deep breath before talking. "For your first question, it is largely a question of 'when'. The arrival of the trans-dimensional traveler introduced new thought process and ideas, going around our blind spot. Eventually, sooner or later, this will result in a constitutional crisis, possibly at a bad time. Worse case scenario? We might lose our disunity, even fracturing. Better we deal with it now, rather than later."

Once again, the parliament broke into confused arguments.

"ORDER! ORDER!" the speaker yelled.

This was going to be a long day.

**Nagai Juri**
**Conference Room, Sidonia**

The allegation and revelation made by the captain was just too much to process, making debates in parliament impossible to advance.

Representative Nagai Juri was always suspicious of the idea that the mask will avoid assassination, but she avoided voicing that particular concern, not seeing how it was any of her business to interfere with something works.

"Political assassination, illegal genetic engineering and cloning, immortality! All behind our back!" an older representative, Seki Kyuwa complained.
