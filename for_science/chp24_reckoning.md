**Sidonia**

I stressed out immediately the moment we arrived back on Sidonia. I can already see some very serious grim looking men with the character 'MP' stenciled on their helmet. They were the military police.

We stepped out, still in our swimsuit.

"Miss Sasaki? Will you please come with us to the police station?" a man in suit said. I sworn under my breath.

"See ya later," Sasaki said casually even as she was led away by military police at both of her side.

Just like that, Sasaki was gone.

"God damn it1" I said out loud, frustrated at not being able to help, and worried about the whole damn thing collapsing like a house of cards.

"We still have to unpack," Diana noted.

"Well, it will keep us busy and not thinking too hard about this situation....I guess."

**Cindy Blue**

The rumors of the Sidonians never having any culture can't scarcely be further away from the truth, especially when correspondent Cindy Blue swallowed her first sushi in a lively and beautiful restaurant in front of the camera crew for the Vales News Network.

Surrounding her was a whole bunch of same-face in their characteristic uniform intently watching her. The Vale News crew were an obvious aberration in the order of things, standing out not only with camera equipment, but also with more variation of appearances through both fashion, body type, and colors. Of Last not lest, they were also foreigners in a very strange and small world.

Blue chewed through her first sushi, trying to get a deep impression of the taste, before swallowing. It was a new...experience.

"So how was it?"

She nodded. "It's good. I am not sure how to describe it? I am not a food critic."

If the Sidonians were cultureless as some Remnan thought, then why do they went through the whole trouble of inventing tasty food?
