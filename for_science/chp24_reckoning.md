**Sidonia**

I stressed out immediately the moment we arrived back on Sidonia. I can already see some very serious grim looking men with the character 'MP' stenciled on their helmet. They were the military police.

We stepped out, still in our swimsuit.

"Miss Sasaki? Will you please come with us to the police station?" a man in suit said. I sworn under my breath.

"See ya later," Sasaki said casually even as she was led away by military police at both of her side.

Just like that, Sasaki was gone.

"God damn it1" I said out loud, frustrated at not being able to help, and worried about the whole damn thing collapsing like a house of cards.

"We still have to unpack," Diana noted.

"Well, it will keep us busy and not thinking too hard about this situation....I guess."

**Hours ago...**
**Cindy Blue**

The rumors of the Sidonians never having any culture can't scarcely be further away from the truth, especially when correspondent Cindy Blue swallowed her first sushi in a lively and beautiful restaurant in front of the camera crew for the Vales News Network.

Surrounding her was a whole bunch of same-face in their characteristic uniform intently watching her. The Vale News crew were an obvious aberration in the order of things, standing out not only with camera equipment, but also with more variation of appearances through both fashion, body type, and colors. Of Last not lest, they were also foreigners in a very strange and small world.

Blue chewed through her first sushi, trying to get a deep impression of the taste, before swallowing. It was a new...experience.

"So how was it?"

She nodded. "It's good. I am not sure how to describe it? I am not a food critic."

Cheers and whistles followed. It's obvious that that the Sidonians took pride in their culture, and they should. Never let any Remnan bigots tells them otherwise!

Her previous experience already told them everything she knew. They were not totalitarians as Archer put it.

"Turn on to the news network! There's something happening in the parliament building!" someone shouted.

She did not understood what that someone say, but her gaze were directed to where the television was located in the restaurant.

The screen flickered to a channel, showing the captain taking off her mask to reveal a beautiful woman's face. This was before a sword laid on the table. Murmurs erupted as chaos broke out on television. Incessant shouting and conversations continued as Blue tried to make sense of the context.

No captain had ever revealed their face to the public before...

"Cindy? This is really important," one of the camerman said.

"Oh, right. Let get started then." She postured herself before a rolling camera before launching herself into the performance. "This is Cindy Blue of the Vales News Network. There's something happening in the Sidonian Diet, the primary lawmaking body of the colony..."

She continued reporting as best as she can, trying to inform viewers about something she barely understand herself.

**Captain Kobayashi**

As the Sidonian Diet were thrown into parliament, she found herself breathing hard while trying to keep calm. Every part of her were repulsed by her own recklessness. She had just unmasked herself to the public, and revealed herself to be an immortal, and now she felt completely safe, at the mercy of potentially very angry Sidonians. It was at this point that political violence became a very real possibility.

But it was also necessary. Sidonia was her home, her life, and her family as much as Nagate and Hiroki were. Escape wasn't an option at all. She must held faith in her people and herself to overcome this.

"Order! Order!" the Speaker of the House commanded. The representatives quickly quieted down. "Captain Kobayashi, can you please verify your identity cryptographically to prove that you are not an imposter."

"I will," she answered.

It didn't take long to input her genetic identity and her public key, and for the verification to complete.

"Very good. I will assume for the time being that we aren't being taken for fools. But, Captain, why now? How are you able to be immortal?"

Kobayashi sighed a deep breath before talking. "For your first question, it is largely a question of 'when'. The arrival of the trans-dimensional traveler introduced new thought process and ideas, going around our blind spot. Eventually, sooner or later, this will result in a constitutional crisis, possibly at a bad time. Worse case scenario? We might lose our disunity, even fracturing. Better we deal with it now, rather than later."

Once again, the parliament broke into confused arguments.

"ORDER! ORDER!" the speaker yelled.

This was going to be a long day.

**Nagai Juri**
**Conference Room, Sidonia**

In a conference room, members of a fraction gathered.

Representative Nagai Juri was always suspicious of the captain. She couldn't help but feel that mask was trying to hide something. It turned out that she was right after all, but that wasn't all that she hoped or wished for.

It would be nice if the conspiracy theories that filled the brains of the deluded were wrong.

"Political assassination, illegal genetic engineering and cloning, immortality! All behind our back!" an older representative, Seki Kyuwa crowed. "How far? How deep?!"

He wildly eyed the people around him. "Some of you could be immortals..."

She put her hand up, signaling for everyone to shut up. "Representative Sako Shiro, I would like you to refrain from spreading paranoia and fear among our elected officials here. We must have faith in the laws and the democratic process even if our captain have subverted the process for hundred of years."

"That's what they want [i]you to say[/i]. All reasonable sounding, but it's a mind control trick! I know it! I opposed the captain all my life. I know all her tricks!" Shiro argued back.

Juri faceplammed, wondering if Shiro was actually an agent of Kobayashi instead.

She grinned silently to herself. If Kobayashi was behind this, there was no possibility of victory after all. It's all an illusion. A wide pervading conspiracy that one can predict and know about in advanced yet cannot do anything about until now? That's absolutely laughable.

**October 13, 2016**

Juri stared across the parliament against the opposition leader, member of the pro-Kobayashi fraction.

Despite the captain's confession of her crimes, which she had certified as not under duress, the pro-Kobayashi fraction didn't shrink as fast as she hoped.

No, they were stubborn in their support for the captain, throwing every wrench into any proceeding that they can, persuading people on the fence to support their cause. Why? Just why? The immortals had shamed the name of Sidonia through their illegal activities and social manipulation. If anything, they should be thrown out of the airlock, every single one of them, even the alleged 'hero' Hiroki Saitou. That wasn't likely to happen. Sidonia was too civilized to allow that kind of barbaric things to happen.

"All those who favored the impeachment of Kobayashi and other immortal officers of Sidonia?"

People pressed their button.

The votes were instantaneously tallied after everyone finished. Fifty-three percent voted 'yes'.

She smiled. Yes, this was a victory. Already, she could see the impassive leader's face frown slightly.

**James Archer**

I was here, alone. Diana decided she wouldn't do anything with Sasaki.

I could understand her viewpoint, but I still loved Sasaki.

"Hi," I said through a phone, connecting to the other side. Guards were present on both sides. "How are you?"

"Holding up. You? How's Diana?"

"I am doing everything as normal as I can, though my stress level hadn't gone down. Diana's not coming to bat for you."

"Figures. The next thing Diana will do is make you decide between her and me."

"No."

"Yes. Trust me, I been around enough to know how relationships work."

"I-I-I love you." God, that was so cheesy.

She smiled. "That's sweet of you, Archer. But there will always be other fishes in the sea. I haven't been your girlfriend for a long time, but it was a very nice time together."


**October 15, 2015**
**Cindy Blue**

How was Cindy Blue supposed to feel about the crisis at hand? There were lockdowns curfew, and yet, there were also reasoned debates by actual citizens.

In fact, as a member of the press, she was given free reign to transmit information back and forth from Sidonia to Remnant, which necessitate the help of James Archer, who was very clearly closely associated with one of the immortals.

The curfews passed quickly and things were already returning to normal. She found herself on the street with her camera crew looking for any passerby.

"Hey, hello?" she said, catching a female Sidonian's attention.

"Excuse me?"

"What do you think of the crisis so far now that things return to normal for the moment?"

"Oh...um...errr..I don't know? Uhhhh. I think the whole idea of a conspiracy is crazy, but evidently it's real...and yet society isn't exploding?"

She sighed to herself. Great. It wasn't only her that felt unsure about this. She pressed on. "What do you think of Kobayashi, who after allegedly hundred of years decided to surrender."

The Sidonian 'hmm' for a bit before answering. "I think what she did that day was brave and moral. Frankly, I don't know of anybody who can do that."

Blue nodded. "Back on Remnant, civil wars and revolutions are generally not peaceful. The people in charge are usually deposed of in some way, sometime ended up being murdered if not simply forced out."

"Umm...we don't have civil war and revolutions on Sidonia. We barely recovered from a near-annihilation a hundred year ago. Or at least that's what the historical archive told us."

"Do you trust the historical archive at all?"

"It's the only thing we can trust, right?"

That's the heart of it. Sidonia didn't tear itself out in an orgy of violence. From what she understood, that could be absolutely disastrous, more disastrous then if it happens on Remnant.

Yet, those people managed to hold on to their sanity, and conduct peacefully among themselves.

That's the really amazing part.

**October 17, 2015**
**James Archer**

Everything went to shit. Seriously.

I arrived back in my apartment after some grocery shopping and some other business to take care of. Just like that, Diana was gone. She left a fucking note that she couldn't stay with me any longer.

I chose nothing. For Diana, as far as she was concerned, that means choosing Sasaki.

Once again, I slumped down in defeat and started crying.
