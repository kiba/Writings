**Sidonia**

I stressed out immediately the moment we arrived back on Sidonia. I can already see some very serious grim looking men with the character 'MP' stenciled on their helmet. They were the military police.

We stepped out, still in our swimsuit.

"Miss Sasaki? Will you please come with us to the police station?" a man in suit said. I sworn under my breath.

"See ya later," Sasaki said casually even as she was led away by military police at both of her side.

Just like that, Sasaki was gone.

"God damn it1" I said out loud, frustrated at not being able to help, and worried about the whole damn thing collapsing like a house of cards.

"We still have to unpack," Diana noted.

"Well, it will keep us busy and not thinking too hard about this situation....I guess"
