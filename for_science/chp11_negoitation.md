**James Archer**

Diana and I finally found myself the opposite of the supposed leader of the colony seedship. Naturally, there were butterflies in my stomach as our freedom were on the lines.

"Archer and Rose, let us get straight to the point, shall we?" the captain said. "Your machine is our salvation, and because of that, we won't let you go until we come to some sort of agreement regarding its use and study."

"Is that a threat?" Diana asked.

"Do I need to pretend it is not? We can do this the hard way, or the easy way."

"No, I get it," I replied.

"But..." Diana said, with a loss for words.

"What are your conditions?"

"First, give us everything you know about trans-dimensional travel and how to build such a device. "

"I am afraid that I can't do in one sitting or without some kind of compensation. I need to get back home. My girlfriend just quitted her job."

"Compensation can be worked out."
