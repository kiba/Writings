**James Archer**

Diana and I finally found myself seated in a meeting room the opposite side of Captain Kobayashi, the commander-in-chief of Sidonia. Naturally, there were butterflies in my stomach as our freedom were on the lines.

The captain was pretty mysterious. Her masks helped, no doubt, as nobody knew her face. Moreover, her biography was entirely empty saved a record of her activities as executive, which weren't always looked upon positively by the citizenry. Turned out that there's a couple of independent poll organization and the approval was never ninety-nine percent.

Anyway, we were at a severe disadvantage in term of information. The negotiation weren't certainly between two co-equal force.

"Archer and Rose, I am sure that you know why you are here," the captain said. "We won't let you go until a deal is made with your machine and knowledge, especially trans-dimensional travel. "

"Is that a threat?" Diana asked.

"Do I need to pretend it is not? We can do this the hard way, or the easy way."

"You let us go! You have no right to do this. I want a lawyer."

"You were the one who had entered a secret section of our ship illegally. For that, we have the authority and right to compound anything you owned."

Diana scoffed.

"Moreover, I am not impressed by your fake outrage."

Oops. Truth to be told, we were not master of negotiation, among other things.

"I believed you do understand the gravity of our situation," the captain continued. "And I would appreciate it if you do not waste both of our time."

If this was drama, the audience would be visibly cringing at our strategy and execution.

I grimaced. "Fine, we'll cut the bullshit."

Diana looked at me. "But..."

"Babe, we're gamed and way of our depth," I argued. Then I looked at the masked woman. "At the very least I want the full anti-aging suite, including immortality if you have it."

"We don't have such capabiliti-" the captain argued back.

"Don't waste both of our time," I parroted back to her. "There's something strange about this society and its absolute acceptance of masked leaders with enormous power."

"Are you a conspiracy theorist?"

"I admit, it's not an ordinary conspiracy, given that this society offered their opinions freely on anything and everything. "

"It's very casual, and there's no evidence of a secret police or a totalitarian society," Diana thought out loud.

The captain scoffed. "You have no evidence that we have such fountain of youth."

"If there's a conspiracy, it's a very smart one," I continued my line of thought. "But thousand of years later, it should already be a done deal. The Sidonians here have no such high opinion of death."

"Why are you continuing this line of thought? Contrary to your view, we do not have such amazing medical technology regardless of your allegation."
