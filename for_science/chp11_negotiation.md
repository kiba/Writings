#chapter 11: Negotiation

## **James Archer**

Diana and I finally found myself seated in a meeting room the opposite side of Captain Kobayashi, the commander-in-chief of Sidonia. Naturally, there were butterflies in my stomach as our freedom were on the lines.

The captain was pretty mysterious. Her masks helped, no doubt, as nobody knew her face. Moreover, her biography was entirely empty saved a record of her activities as executive, which weren't always looked upon positively by the citizenry. Turned out that there's a couple of independent poll organization and the approval was never ninety-nine percent.

Anyway, we were at a severe disadvantage in term of information. The negotiation weren't certainly between two co-equal force.

"Archer and Rose, I am sure that you know why you are here," the captain said. "We won't let you go until a deal is made with your machine and knowledge, especially trans-dimensional travel. "

"Is that a threat?" Diana asked.

"Do I need to pretend it is not? We can do this the hard way, or the easy way."

"You let us go! You have no right to do this. I want a lawyer."

"You were the one who had entered a secret section of our ship illegally. For that, we have the authority and right to compound anything you owned."

Diana scoffed.

"Moreover, I am not impressed by your fake outrage."

Oops. Truth to be told, we were not master of negotiation, among other things.

"I believed you do understand the gravity of our situation," the captain continued. "And I would appreciate it if you do not waste both of our time."

If this was drama, the audience would be visibly cringing at our strategy and execution.

I grimaced. "Fine, we'll cut the bullshit."

Diana looked at me. "But..."

"Babe, we're gamed and way of our depth," I argued. Then I looked at the masked woman. "At the very least I want the full medical care package, including immortality if you have it."

"We don't have such capabiliti-" the captain argued back.

"You can do photosynthesis but not defeat aging?"

"Those two are completely orthogonal."

"Yet, the ability to photosynthesis demonstrated a mastery of bioengineering and the medical science. One of your scientist described as one of the greatest and most complicated feat ever attempted on the human body."

"Believe what you will, we do not a fountain of youth despite your allegation, despite our most fervent wishes."

"Right..."

Diana pulled on my shoulder. "What're you doing? They made it clear that they're not going to give us immortality, -if- they have it. We saw that they use fucking mecha for space battles."

"It's an obviously flawed design!"

"Saski convinced me beyond a shred of doubt-"

"It could be Sidonia's reality distortion field!"

She sighed in frustration.

"We're getting a bit off-topic, " the captain said. "Perhaps we should take a break."

"Yes," my girlfriend replied, before the both of us headed into a private room for our own use.

I think we fucked up royally.

## **Captain Kobayashi**
**Hours ago.**

Lala Hiyama wasn't the least happy when she was finally told the news. Not after Kobayashi murdered the council in cold blooded. The bear's roar was absolutely clamorous in its fury, though it was confined to her chamber.

Still, Kobayashi stood her ground as the dorm mother bear cussed her out.

"Why the fuck you do that?" Hiyama finally asked.

"You know as well as I do that they are a threat to our lives. One wrong move, we could end up dead."

"That doesn't make it right, and you know it."

"It's for the good of Sidonia."

"If they are a threat, you could have arranged for a trial of some kind."

"Somehow I doubt that would be a good idea in the first place. Explaining to the court that we need to arrest the immortal committee could easily alert them to my intention, and it could easily went the other way around. They may be senile and corrupt, but they were no fools."

The bear glanced away, staying silent on that particular issue.

"Regardless, the future is changing."

"Yes, because you-"

"Their assassination was catalyzed by something else entirely unrelated, actually. Somebody discovered a way to travel between the multiverse."

"Excuse me?"

"You heard me correctly. Somebody made a breakthrough to make what was previously science fiction into a physical possibility. Sasaki and Shinatose can fill you on it. Anyway, that changed things. If we could travel to an alternate reality, it's possible that we may face military conflict. I want to prepare for that eventuality. That means finding Hiroki and his clone-, son."

"The immortal committee members are dead, right?"

"Yes, those who were supported by life equipment in the council chambers were killed," the captain said, before saying something else completely. "Sidonia is my soul and life."

"That's the safe phrase," the bear noted. "So, we're free after all." It was one of the duress phrase established by the two immortals, one that indicated that no hostilities was coercing Kobayashi and that it was safe to talk. In this case, it was more of a remainder and reassurance.

The bear sighed in relief. "I'll go and retrieve Hiroki and his son."

"Thank you."

"You want me to explain everything with regard to trans-dimensional travel?" I asked.

"Yes," Kobayashi replied.

"Do you have any idea how long that will take? I still haven't explained much if any to my girlfriend."

"I am sure that it will take a lifetime to understand..."

"No, you don't understand. I got a life back here."

"And so do I" Rose concurred.

"We're homesick and we want to go home."

"I supposed we could arrange visitation and consultation period, but we have no assurance that you will go back."

"If you provide us with technological assistance and knowledge, I am sure we'll go back," Rose said.

"Yeah, what she said."

"Sorry, I am not predisposed to just trusting you, even with our assistance to you. "

"What do you propose then?"

"A citizenship, perhaps marriage with one of my people here, or that one of you stay here."

I looked at Rose, not sure if I wanted to be separated a reality away. Then I looked at Kobayashi again and scoffed, crossing my arms.

"I am sorry, but I am loyal to America only," I said rather proudly. If nothing else, I believe in the dream and promises of America, in spite of the many mistakes and atrocity that had been committed in its name.

"Ah, I forget sometime. This is before the unification of ancient Earth. I think you could do better than that. How about loyalty to humanity? That was the apotheosis of Earth civilization."

Damn...I didn't really think of that. I always thought of myself as American first.

"We're loyal to Sidonia, because that's all there is of humanity as far as we know," Kobayashi carried on.
