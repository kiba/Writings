**Headmaster Ozpin**
**Beacon Academy, Remnant**

The interdimensional news washed over Ozpin as he sipped his coffee at four AM in the morning. While it was embarrassing to admit, the informants were no better than the correspondent reporting from Sidonia.

Even before inter-dimensional travel became a thing, he made it his business to stay on top of political matters, even as boring as bills, so he can best accomplish his job under the political reality.

In Sidonia, he carefully cultivated his sources in varying industries and occupations, taking care not to be 'spying' or commiting any acts that might be construed as 'espionage'. After all, the information should all be open source, all above ground, not state secrets. It was information that anyone could get, but it was hard to collate unless one have an information network.

Alas, there's only so much information he could have gathered.

He expected to be caught by surprise, but he never thought of this.

He heard the footsteps of Glynda Goodwitch.

"Welcome," he greeted.

"Good morning headmaster Ozpin," she responded.

"Still working out the Sidonian crisis?"

"I have no doubt about the importance of the arkship to our future. I just don't understand the direction that Sidonia will take. Maybe the Sidonians don't themselves either. This is an unprecedented situation."

"Governments change from time to time in both of their histories and ours."

"But they don't really match up, do they? Professor Obleck said that history don't really repeat itself, but it rhymes."

Goodwitch watched the broadcast for a bit. The correspondent, Cindy Blue was interviewing a man named Sako Shiro, rambling on about democracy and civilian rule.

"Democracies. I don't understand how they work."

Ozpin chuckled. "They don't, not really. They have a highly qualified civil service branch that papered over much of that. Unlike here, they seemed to believe that democracy is a direct expression of liberty, but they also have check and balance that ensured that the individuals are not run over."

Goodwitch scoffed. "Sounded like a contradictory system."

"It is what it is. If you look at ours, it's not like we're any better. We have a system that works, mostly."

"They're going through a crisis, right now."

"And we been through ours several decades ago. Their system works for over a century until this trans-reality revolution happens."

"We disgress long enough, what's your feel for this situation?"

Ozpin sighed. "The worst case scenario would be that they turned militant, turn their eyes on us and Earth. I don't see it as likely. Their leadership and politicans extended their hands out to us, and Cindy Blue is still on Sidonia."

"She seemed totally unconcerned."

"I agreed. The fact that they haven't banned us and allowed coverage for Remnant is good news. We could similarly consider isolationism an unlikely possibility. Of course, it's still early days, so we should not be caught off-guard."

"The next likely scenario?"

"We might get a flood of refugees or aslyum seekers. I believed our political masters are hoping exactly for that, but I explicitly forewarned them not to expect any aslyum applications. Even if we were to accept aslyum seekers sometime in the near future, integration is also a concern. Professor Oobleck pointed out that Remnant do not have any experience in assimilating foreign people into any of our kingdoms."

"The Sidonians are easily the most educated people I know. I can see why they want to snap them up."

"Indeed, they would prove a boon to our kingdoms, but as is, we already are benefiting from them. We also need to consider the negatives of a weakened kingdom of the ark. Supposed that there are aslyum seekers, but not to enough to offset the damage to our trade relationship. If they pulled back to focus on their own internal affair, we would lose out."

"I can see the worry, but I just don't know how we would effect the outcome to our favor."

"That's why the four kingdoms are sending diplomats. We're trying to connect with as many fraction as possible, get more ears on their ground floor, and hope that we'll be able to continue our relationship as before."
