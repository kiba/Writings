**Headmaster Ozpin**
**Beacon Academy, Remnant**

The interdimensional news washed over Ozpin as he sipped his coffee at four AM in the morning. While it was embarrassing to admit, the informants were no better than the correspondent reporting from Sidonia.

Even before inter-dimensional travel became a thing, he made it his business to stay on top of political matters, even as boring as bills, so he can best accomplish his job under the political reality.

In Sidonia, he carefully cultivated his sources in varying industries and occupations, taking care not to be 'spying' or commiting any acts that might be construed as 'espionage'. After all, the information should all be open source, all above ground, not state secrets. It was information that anyone could get, but it was hard to collate unless one have an information network.

Alas, there's only so much information he could have gathered.

He expected to be caught by surprise, but he never thought of this.

He heard the footsteps of Glynda Goodwitch.

"Welcome," he greeted.

"Good morning headmaster Ozpin," she responded.

"Still working out the Sidonian crisis?"

"I have no doubt about the importance of the arkship to our future. I just don't understand the direction that Sidonia will take. Maybe the Sidonians don't themselves either. This is an unprecedented situation."

"Governments change from time to time in both of their histories and ours."

"But they don't really match up, do they? Professor Obleck said that history don't really repeat itself, but it rhymes."

Goodwitch watched the broadcast for a bit. The correspondent, Cindy Blue was interviewing a man named Sako Shiro, rambling on about democracy and civilian rule.

"Democracies. I don't understand how they work."

Ozpin chuckled. "They don't, not really. They have a highly qualified civil service branch that papered over much of that. Unlike here, they seemed to believe that democracy is a direct expression of liberty, but they also have check and balance that ensured that the individuals are not run over."

Goodwitch scoffed. "Sounded like a contradictory system."

"It is what it is. If you look at ours, it's not like we're any better. We have a system that works, mostly."

"They're going through a crisis, right now."

"And we been through ours several decades ago. Their system works for over a century until this trans-reality revolution happens."

"We disgress long enough, what's your feel for this situation?"

Ozpin sighed. "The worst case scenario would be that they turned militant, turn their eyes on us and Earth. I don't see it as likely. Their leadership and politicans extended their hands out to us, and Cindy Blue is still on Sidonia."

"She seemed totally unconcerned."

"I agreed. The fact that they haven't banned us and allowed coverage for Remnant is good news. We could similarly consider isolationism an unlikely possibility. Of course, it's still early days, so we should not be caught off-guard."

"The next likely scenario?"

"We might get a flood of refugees or aslyum seekers. I believed our political masters are hoping exactly for that, but I explicitly forewarned them not to expect any aslyum applications. Even if we were to accept aslyum seekers sometime in the near future, integration is also a concern. Professor Oobleck pointed out that Remnant do not have any experience in assimilating foreign people into any of our kingdoms."

"The Sidonians are easily the most educated people I know. I can see why they want to snap them up."

"Indeed, they would prove a boon to our kingdoms, but as is, we already are benefiting from them. We also need to consider the negatives of a weakened kingdom of the ark. Supposed that there are aslyum seekers, but not to enough to offset the damage to our trade relationship. If they pulled back to focus on their own internal affair, we would lose out."

"I can see the worry, but I just don't know how we would effect the outcome to our favor."

"That's why the four kingdoms are sending diplomats. We're trying to connect with as many fraction as possible, get more ears on their ground floor, and hope that we'll be able to continue our relationship as before."

Goodwitch sighed. "It seems that we huntsmen are unable to contribute a solution to this crisis. I guess our students won't be able to complain about their humanity classes for quite awhile..."

"The best we can do is simply watch and re-adjust..."

**Takei Nori**

**Sidonia**

It was a white room, completely clinical and utterly devoid of almost all features. A beautiful woman sat before him.

He knew that she wasn't in any way, young. A literal six hundred years old was sitting before him, the connection before the apocalypse that nearly wiped out one of the last known bastion of humanity. Allegedly, she was part of a powerful conspiracy to rule Sidonia from behind, now revealed to him and the public.

 Allegedly, she is one of those immortals that ruled Sidonia from behind, now unseated from their powers. its members either fleeing away from authority or are on the

"You are six hundred years old," Takei Nori said. "Yet only until five days ago, you revealed your existence to us. I was dragged out of retirement simply because they couldn't trust all those youthful faces. This is the younger generation's problem, not mine. I am about to bite the dust."

"The situation changed. There's a medicine out there that will make this your problem."

"My problem? I don't trust a word out of your mouth. You see...you lied to us for my whole life, and perhaps my parents as well, and my grand-parents, and countless generations before that. You think I can turn around and just ingest a new type of pill that hadn't been verified by the medical committee, a committee that's potentially compromised by more of those 'youthful' faces?"

"I eliminated most of the immortal ship committee. They can't be everywhere at once."

"Yeah, that's just another problem. You murdered them, or you ordered that assistant of your to carry them out. That mean that you were living in an abnormal environment that twisted your morality and thought process."

There was no change in composure, just more of her steely eyes.

"An abnormal environment that also twisted their thought process," she said. "At some point, they stopped thinking of you and everyone else as their progeny. The progeny we educated, donated our genes to, and genetically engineered for life after the apocalypse. I made the decision to protect all of you from the decisions they would had made once they forced me from my position."

"That is not how Sidonia do things. We would never let someone do that in our name."

"No. That is not the Sidonian way. But it is survival."

"That's your excuse? I don't believe it's good enough. Frankly, I am disgusted, not by your clearly illegal rule, but by your immoral actions against those alleged tyrants. What I want to know is...why now? Why did you disclose? Expose every terrible secrets?"

"Duty. Isn't that enough? Haven't I told you? Won't you believe me?"

"I think you are a tyrant, elder," he said with venom. "Tyrants all throughout history frequently rationalize their actions as some part of some moral program, but that doesn't make them just or normal."

"I know what I did, and I did it for my own reason. It was necessary to get rid of the committee, but I couldn't bring myself to expose this to the public. At that time, the cost-benefit analysis to Sidonia seemed to be poor. I'll also admit that it's self serving. Even after six hundred years, I still do not tired of life."

"A tyrant who acknowledged her crime. That's something."

"I am not a tyrant. People outside of my circle never had their political freedom violated in any way, and everyone served in a meritocracy, or as best as I can manage it."

"We'll see what the politician thinks when the impeachment trial take place."

**Cindy Blue**
**October 17, 2015**

She sighed loudly as she collapsed into a couch inside a room that Vale news crew were renting for the stay. The crisis was in its seventh day and it shown no sign of abatement. On the other hand, they hadn't kicked her news crew out, nor was were any kind of violence. Even more astounding, more Remnans came on board to witness the crisis or to intermingle with the Sidonians.

Political subfractions began forming at a rapid place, all with different opinions on how to do things. It was pure chaos. At least the Remnan political scenes are simpler.

Blue wasn't a political correspondent. Yet, she became one by sheer necessity.

A phone rang just now.

"Make it go away," she said, her voice hoarse from all the talking.

Unfortunately, the director have to do her job.

All she heard was the director's side of the conversation, but she knew it was more of the same job.
