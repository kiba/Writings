**Headmaster Ozpin**
**Beacon Academy, Remnant**

The interdimensional news washed over Ozpin as he sipped his coffee at four AM in the morning. While it was embarrassing to admit, the informants were no better than the correspondent reporting from Sidonia.

Even before inter-dimensional travel became a thing, he made it his business to stay on top of political matters, even as boring as bills, so he can best accomplish his job under the political reality.

In Sidonia, he carefully cultivated his sources in varying industries and occupations, taking care not to be 'spying' or commiting any acts that might be construed as 'espionage'. After all, the information should all be open source, all above ground, not state secrets. It was information that anyone could get, but it was hard to collate unless one have an information network.

Alas, there's only so much information he could have gathered.

He expected to be caught by surprise, but he never thought of this.

He heard the footsteps of Glynda Goodwitch.

"Welcome," he greeted.

"Good morning headmaster Ozpin," she responded.

"Still working out the Sidonian crisis?"

"I have no doubt about the importance of the arkship to our future. I just don't understand the direction that Sidonia will take. Maybe the Sidonians don't themselves either. This is an unprecedented situation."
