# **Chapter Fifteen: Discovery Time**

**Forest 19, Vale**
**Lieutenant Akeno Noguchi**
**June 5, 2015**

Transiting was still an unpleasant affair as Akeno contemplated his growing nausea and his partner in this operation, Toma Keiko. They just arrived in the middle of a forest in a raging storm, with heavy rain and rolling thunders.

"You're going to be alright, Keiko-sensei?" he asked the anthropologist.

"Yeah..." she said.

Thanks to the pill both took earlier, the nausea rapidly faded away.  The lieutenant then handed out Keiko her raincoat. Luckily they weren't in their EVA. For this mission, the higher ups had decided that it would be unnecessary and that the two-person crew will have to blend in using the local fashion.

The rain didn't subsided a bit when they left the TDM and entered the side of a road. Once they were a few meters away, the TDM machine disappeared into thin air, making that characteristic transition sound.

"It's going to be a long walk," the lieutenant said as they trekked across a muddy road toward the city near the coast.

They were in a forested area inside the heavily guarded border of this city-state, according to the analysis of the reconnaissance video and radio recordings captured by the probes.

What didn't make sense was that there was almost nothing outside the city border, just a virtually endless pristine wilderness and sparse roads leading to the outside world.

What was out there? The local radio broadcasting station naturally leave out a lot of context that people would automatically know from just living there.

Sidonia elected to send Lieutenant Noguchi and Doctor Toma on a short term infiltration mission to gather information discretely up close and personal.

**Sill Silvers**

When the weather was bad, customers were dissuaded from visiting, and therefore today's a slow business day. Still pawn shop owner Sill Silver didn't close today, nor would he close on any day of the week, not even on a holiday. He hadn't have a vacation for close to five years since he opened his shop.

Truth be told, a lot of potential customers still held grudges against Faunus, and invisibly decided to not patronize his business. So much for the Faunus Rights Revolution, and the ever improving equality between faunus and humans. It wasn't surprising in the least that a significant percentage of his customers are faunus, though the majority are still humans.

For his part, Sil didn't gouge or favor any of them. Why should he made the effort for integration, however slow going, more difficult than it is?

A door bell rung.

The shopkeeper was alerted out of his thought process to the presence of two human beings in blue raincoats. He can hear the wet squishing sound of their boot as the rainwater dripped away from their coat.

They pulled down their hoods, and immediately he noticed the similarity between two individuals, with their pale skin, black hair, and almond eyes. They must be related to each other then.

"Good evening," the male said with a noticeable accent as he pulled out a bag of diamond encrusted jewelries. The shopkeeper couldn't place the accent. Was it's Mistral, Atlas, or Vacuo? Does it matters at all? "How much do they sell for?"

Ah, a classic mistake.

He lowballed the number to his customers, hoping that they took in the bait. The humans glanced each other and muttered a few words.

The shopkeeper was stumped. They were inscrutable. In his line of work, being able to read body languages and faces was how he makes a living. Getting a good deal was a necessary requirement if he wants to make a profit and keep himself in business.

"We think that they not good prices," the male said in slightly broken Valeish before correcting himself. "Sorry, we think it's not a good price."

Sil scrutinized the jewelry quickly before looking up. Some were unfamiliar, but a lot wasn't. He been through a lot of them, and he knew how to recognize the bad from the good ones.

"Well, look here...those are unknown jewelries," Sil said. "Contrary to popular beliefs, unpopular or unique one of a kind jewelries don't sell well. Where did you get these?"

"They were my grandmother's heirloom, unfortunately." It was a bare-naked lie. That raised a red flag for Silver. If he brought stolen merchandise, there would be a strong possibility of police coming to take back the merchandise and he'll be out of whatever the price he will bought the goods for.

"Oh, I got a lot of those stories. People sell them because of the desperate financial stride they're often in, sometime of their own making, sometime not. They're definitely real tragedies. This is how I make my money. But I also know when someone is lying to me. Did you steal them?" The shop owner schooled his expression and concentrated sharply on both of his customers' face.

There was a strong reaction from both of them. He could feel the sheer fury and outrage from the man, with his sibling stepping back quickly. In just a second however, the humans quickly recomposed themselves.

"No," the female spoke with strong resolution. "We did not steal them."

"Your story is full of shit, but you did not steal them. I presume that you didn't come into possession using somewhat shady means?"

There was no trepidation or enmity he can detect, but it seemed that they were hiding something from him, but what in the world could they possibly be hiding?

"Are you still considering buying them from us?"

"Yes." In the ended, the shopkeeper decided that it was worth the risk.

Then the gentleman named his price.

"LUDICROUS!" he roared. "Look man, I am never ever going to buy it any price. It would bankrupt me."

After a couple of rounds of haggling back and forth, the siblings and the pawn shop owner finally agreed to a price. The jewelries were exchanged for a sizable amount of liens and a receipt. Then the duo disappeared into the rain, leaving behind wet tracks in the highly organized pawnshop.

It was a good deal, he thought. However, he will need to contact a friend to take a good look at it. He knew a lot about diamonds and jewelries but a jeweler would of course know more. The only other thing of note was the rather unusual exchange with the customers, but he thought nothing further of it.

**Lieutenant Akeno Noguchi**

"Let's look for a cheap motel," the lieutenant said.

"You think they required identification?" the anthropologist asked.

"No? The pawnshop keeper didn't ask for it."

"Right."

Thievery was virtually unheard of in Sidonia. Nobody went hungry, and everybody has a place and role in society. It was more common to see thieves in the realm of fiction and from studying the historical records. But this isn't what plagued the lieutenant.

"The shopkeeper we met was very perceptive," he noted.

"Maybe we stand out?"

"Of course. But whatever he felt, he decided that he would continue doing business with us. It was very informative." The primary objective back at the shop wasn't to sell diamonds for local currency, though it was one of their goal, but to learn the basic process for buying and selling goods in this society.

Sure enough, after looking through two or three business place and ascertaining the price, they were able to get a room with no identification necessary, given that liens seemed to function as cash. If they were to use something like a debit card, that would more likely require identification.

The motel room was clean, though the decor left a lot to be desired. However, it seemed that there were a level of solidness in the locals' architecture that Earth and even some Sidonian buildings lack.

"Surveillance footage revealed the local's fondness for strong primary colors, though I didn't expect it to extend to its decor," the lieutenant said, commenting on the choices made for this motel room, which made the room an eyesore to look at.

"There's probably a reason for why the locals are choosing such colors and all the names are apparently related to colors. I heard about this 'great war' or simply the 'war'," the anthropologist commented.

"Which is why we're hitting the bookstore tomorrow."

"Agreed."

The soldier took out a tablet from his backpack and begun composing a journal log for the mission. Meanwhile, the anthropologist took out her phone and begun photographing every centimeter of the space.

"What you're doing?"

"You can infer a lot of information from just this room. We can compare it to our database ancient Earth hotels."

"We're going to be doing that a lot, aren't we? Looking at the most ordinary of details."

"How else are we going to gather useful intelligence without being noticed by the locals?"

He smiled and went back to work on his report.

**Doctor Keiko Toma**
**June 6, 2015**

Books were very useful, Keiko decided, and with some need to move inventory, can be very cheap for the buyers. After entering a bookstore called [i]Tukson's Book Trade[/i], she went on a spending spree buying all the clearance items. Which was how she learned the word for humans with furry features, 'faunus', after mistakenly calling the owner a 'human'. Though even after the correction of terminology, to her, they weren't different races or species.

Afterward, they had taken all day just scanning the contents of books, reading, and recording annotations.

"Those Grimm...You think they're real?" the lieutenant said, uncertainly.

"It does fit in what we know," Keiko said. "A broken moon, and a world called Remnant, mostly infested by the creatures of darkness. Does that seems natural to you?"

"No. Not in the least. And the planet isn't certainly Earth, unless Earth has a huge geographic divergence."

There was a stomach growl coming from the lieutenant.

"You're confident enough to try ordering food?"

"Sure."

***

It was already nightime when the duo went around sightseeing after dinner. One could see the clear glow of the shattered moon. Holographic lamp lighted the street, and there appeared to be nothing happening.

"One last thing before we go home," Noguchi said, pointing to a shop called Dust Till Dawn. "Sample acquisition of dust."

Dust appeared to be how the locals powered their technology and civilization, and there's nothing like it in the Sidonian knowledge database. So, it naturally became a priority for Sidonia to acquire a sample for study.

Suddenly, the window of the shop shattered and out came a girl with red cape in black skirt, and a large metal object.

"What in the world?" the anthropologist asked as the duo froze themselves at the worst seconds in the middle of an encountered.

"Let get-" the lieutanant shouted before he was soaked in bullets from the cross-fire moments later.

"Noguchi-san!" the doctor shouted as she tried to help her partner.

The fight continued, and more bullets rung out, striking the doctor as well, before falling down herself.

There were plenty more explosion before the sounds of jet arrived.

What was going on? Was she's going to die here on a foreign planet in a foreign universe. That can't be...possible.

Soon, she was drifting out and in of consciousness, listening to frantic voices and sound of sirens. She couldn't think anymore.

Then, there was nothing but a deep sleep.

**Glynda Goodwitch**

Goodwitch was drenched in blood as she calmly assess the civilians for injuries. She had already ripped off the clothes to take a look at the injuries, and it wasn't good, but not fatal either. They hadn't hit any vital location, but they were losing a significant amount of blood quickly.

She could already hear distress of the young huntress-in-training. "Stay calm," she said. "This is what you were trained to do so."

"I am going to need your cape as tourniquet," the professor said. Once she was handed the girl's cape, the huntress tore it in pieces so that she could tie it in multiple places.

There was a wail of siren coming from the ambulance. Good. The huntress was trained in first aid care as part of her profession, but she was not a doctor or a paramedic.

"You're coming with me, young lady," she ordered. "Be ready to help them as needed."

This was getting to be a long night.

"Why..why are they like that?" the red tinted girl said. "Is..is..it my fault?"

"I don't know," Goodwitch admitted. "This should not had happened, not with the bullets that were used."
