# **Chapter Fifteen: Discovery Time**

**Forest 19, Vale**
**Lieutenant Akeno Noguchi**

Transiting was still an unpleasant affair as Akeno contemplated his growing nausea and his partner in this operation, Toma Keiko. They just arrived in the middle of a forest in a raging storm, with heavy rain and rolling thunders.

"You're going to be alright, Keiko-sensei?" he asked the anthropologist.

"Yeah..." she said.

Thanks to the pill both took earlier, the nausea rapidly faded away.  The lieutenant then handed out Keiko her raincoat. Luckily they weren't in their EVA. For this mission, the higher ups had decided that it would be unnecessary and that the two-person crew will have to blend in using the local stylings.

The rain didn't subsided a bit when they left the TDM and entered the side of a road. Once they were a few meters away, the TDM machine disappeared into thin air, making that characteristic transition sound.

"It's going to be a long walk," the lieutenant said as they trekked across a muddy road toward the city near the coast.

They were in a forested area inside the heavily guarded border of this city-state, so far as the reconnaissance video and radio recording were able to tell.

What didn't make sense was that there was almost nothing outside the city border, just a virtually endless pristine wilderness and sparse roads leading to the outside world.

What was out there? The local radio broadcasting station naturally leave out a lot of context that people would automatically know from just living there.

Sidonia elected to send Lieutenant Noguchi and Doctor Toma on a short term infiltration mission to gather information discretely up close and personal.

**Sill Silvers**

When the weather was bad, customers were dissuaded from visiting, and therefore today's a slow business day. Still pawn shop owner Sill Silver didn't close today, nor would he close on any day of the week, not even on a holiday. He hadn't have a vacation for close to five years since he opened his shop.

Truth be told, a lot of potential customers still held grudges against Faunus, and invisibly decided to not patronize his business. So much for the Faunus Rights Revolution, and the ever improving equality between faunus and humans. It wasn't surprising in the least that a significant percentage of his customers are faunus, though the majority are still humans.

For his part, Sil didn't gouge or favor any of them. Why should he made the effort for integration, however slow going, more difficult than it is?

A door bell rung.

The shopkeeper was alerted out of his thought process to the presence of two human beings in raincoat. He can hear the wet squishing sound of their boot as the rainwater dripped away from their coat.

They pulled down their hoods, and immediately he noticed the similarity between two individuals, with their pale skin, black hair, and almond eyes. They must be related to each other then.

"Good evening," the male said with a noticeable accent as he pulled out a bag of diamond encrusted jewelries. The shopkeeper couldn't place the accent. Was it's Mistral, Atlas, or Vacuo? "How much do they sell for?"

Ah, a classic mistake.

He lowballed the number to his customers, hoping that they took in the bait. The humans glanced each other and muttered a few words.

The shopkeeper was stumped. They were inscrutable. In his line of work, being able to read body languages and faces was how he makes a living. Getting a good deal was a necessary requirement if he wants to make a profit and keep himself in business.

"We think that they not good prices," the male said.

Sil scrutinized the jewelry quickly before looking up. Some were unfamiliar, but a lot wasn't. He been through a lot of them, and he knew how to recognize the bad from the good ones.

"Well, look here...those are unknown jewelries," Sil said. "Contrary to popular beliefs, unpopular jewelries don't sell well. Where did you get these?"

"They were my grandmother's heirloom, unfortunately." It was a bare-naked lie. That raised a red flag for Silver. If he brought stolen merchandise, there would be a strong possibility of police coming to take back the merchandise and he'll be out of the money that he brought.

"Oh, I got a lot of those stories. People sell them because of the desperate financial stride they're often in, sometime of their own making, sometime not. They're definitely real tragedies. But I also know when someone is lying to me. Did you steal them?" The shop owner schooled his expression and concentrated sharply on both of his customers' face.

There was a strong reaction from both of them. He could feel the sheer fury and outrage from the man, with his sibling stepping back quickly. In just a second, the humans quickly recomposed themselves.

"No," the female spoken with strong resolution. "We did not steal them."

"Your story is full of shit, but you did not steal them. I presume that you didn't come into possession using somewhat shady means."

There was no trepidation or enmity he can detect, but it seemed that they were hiding something. What in the world are those two hiding?

"Are you still considering buying them from us?"

"Yes."

Then the gentleman named his price.

"LUDICROUS!" he roared. "Look man, I am never ever going to buy it any price. It would bankrupt me."

After a couple of rounds of haggling back and forth, the siblings and the pawn shop owner finally agreed to a price. The jewelries were exchanged for liens and receipt. Then the duo disappeared into the rain, leaving behind wet tracks in the highly organized pawnshop.

It was a good deal, he thought. However, he will need to contact a friend to take a good look at it. He knew a lot about diamonds and jewelries but a jeweler would of course know more. The only other thing of note was the rather unusual exchange with the customers, but he thought nothing further of it.

**Lieutenant Akeno Noguchi**

"Let look for a cheap motel," the lieutenant said.

"You think they required identification?" the anthropologist asked.

"No? The pawnshop keeper didn't ask for it."

"Right."

Thievery was virtually unheard of in Sidonia. Nobody went hungry, and everybody has a place and role in society. It was more common to see thieves in the realm of fiction and from studying the historical records. But this isn't what plague the lieutenant.

"The shopkeeper we met was very perceptive," he noted.

"Maybe we stand out?"

"Of course. But he felt that it was the worth of doing business with us. It was very informative." The primary objective back at the shop wasn't to sell diamonds for local currency, though it was one of their goal, but to learn the basic process for buying and selling goods in this society.

Sure enough, after looking through two or three business place and ascertaining the price, they were able to get a room with no identification necessary, given that liens seemed to function as cash. If they were to use something like a debit card, they would required identification.

The motel room was clean, though the decor left a lot to be desired. However, it seemed that there were a level of solidness in the locals' architecture that Earth and even Sidonian buildings lack.

"Surveillance footage revealed the local's fondness for strong primary colors, though I didn't expect it to extend to its decor," the lieutenant said, commenting on the choices made for this motel room, which made the room an eyesore to look at.

"There's probably a reason for why the locals are choosing such colors and all the names are apparently related to colors. I heard about this 'great war' or simply the 'war'," the anthropologist commented.

"Which is why we're hitting the bookstore tomorrow."

"Agreed."

The soldier took out a tablet from his backpack and begun composing a journal log for the mission. Meanwhile, the anthropologist took out her phone and begun photographing every centimeter of the space.

"What you're doing?"

"You can infer a lot of information from just this room. We can compare it to our database ancient Earth hotels."

"We're going to be doing that a lot, aren't we? Looking at the most ordinary of details."

"How else are we going to gather useful intelligence without being noticed by the locals?"

He smiled and went back to work on his report.
