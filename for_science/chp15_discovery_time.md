# **Chapter Fifteen: Discovery Time**

**Forest 19, Vale**
**Akeno Noguchi**

Transiting was still an unpleasant affair as Akeno contemplated his growing nausea and his companion, Toma Keiko. They just arrived in the middle of a forest in a raging storm, with heavy rain and rolling thunders.

"You're going to be alright, Keiko-sensei?" he asked the anthropologist.

"Yeah..." she said.

Thanks to the pill both took earlier, the nausea rapidly faded away.  The lieutenant then handed out Keiko her raincoat. Luckily they weren't in their EVA. For this mission, the higher ups had decided that it would be unnecessary and that the two-person crew will have to blend in using the local stylings.

The rain didn't subsided a bit when they left the TDM and entered the side of a road. Once they were a few meters away, the TDM machine disappeared into thin air, making that characteristic transition sound.

"It's going to be a long walk," the lieutenant said as they trekked across a muddy road toward the city near the coast.

They were in a forested area inside the heavily guarded border of this city-state, so far as the reconnaissance video and radio recording were able to tell.

What didn't make sense was that there was almost nothing outside the city border, just a virtually endless pristine wilderness and sparse roads leading to the outside world.

What was out there? The local radio broadcasting station naturally leave out a lot of context that people would automatically know from just living there.

Sidonia elected to send Lieutenant Noguchi and Doctor Toma on a short term infiltration mission to gather information discretely up close and personal.

**Sill**

When the weather was bad, customers were dissuaded from visiting, and therefore today's a slow business day. Still pawn shop owner Sill didn't close today, nor would he close on any day of the week, not even on a holiday. He hadn't have a vacation for close to five years.

Truth be told, a lot of potential customers held still grudges against Faunus, and just decided to not patronize his business. So much for the Faunus Rights Revolution, and the ever improving equality between fanus and humans.

There's just nothing he could do about it.

A door bell rung.

The shopkeeper was alerted out of his thought process to the presence of two human beings in raincoat. He can hear the wet squishing sound of their boot as the rainwater dripped away from their coat.

They pulled down their hoods, and immediately he noticed the similarity between two individuals, with their pale skin, black hair, and almond eyes. They must be related to each other then.

"Good evening," the male said with a noticible accent as he pulled out a bag of diamonds. The shopkeeper couldn't place the accent. Was it's Mistral, Atlas, or Vacuos? "How much do they sell for?"

Ah, a classic mistake.
