# **Chapter 15: Discovery Time**

## **Ruby Rose**

Ruby Rose blinked at the object that appeared out of nowhere after making that silly laser sounds. You know, 'pew!pew!'.

It was...a robot of some kind, but definitely not the walking kind.

"Did anyone see what I see?" She pointed out the machine to everyone else.

"Miss Rose, I can assure you that it's not a figment of your imagination," Goodwitch said.

Everyone else was also looking at it. But nobody was sure how to react, given it wasn't there just a second ago.

It didn't looked like a robot that could survive a fight with a creature of the Grimm, since it lacked any sort of visible armament.

Finally the machine spoke, "Greeting, this is the exploration probe Curiosity, on a mission to explore new worlds. We come in peace."
