# **Chapter Fifteen: Discovery Time**

**Forest 19, Vale**
**Lieutenant Akeno Noguchi**

Transiting was still an unpleasant affair as Akeno contemplated his growing nausea and his partner in this operation, Toma Keiko. They just arrived in the middle of a forest in a raging storm, with heavy rain and rolling thunders.

"You're going to be alright, Keiko-sensei?" he asked the anthropologist.

"Yeah..." she said.

Thanks to the pill both took earlier, the nausea rapidly faded away.  The lieutenant then handed out Keiko her raincoat. Luckily they weren't in their EVA. For this mission, the higher ups had decided that it would be unnecessary and that the two-person crew will have to blend in using the local stylings.

The rain didn't subsided a bit when they left the TDM and entered the side of a road. Once they were a few meters away, the TDM machine disappeared into thin air, making that characteristic transition sound.

"It's going to be a long walk," the lieutenant said as they trekked across a muddy road toward the city near the coast.

They were in a forested area inside the heavily guarded border of this city-state, so far as the reconnaissance video and radio recording were able to tell.

What didn't make sense was that there was almost nothing outside the city border, just a virtually endless pristine wilderness and sparse roads leading to the outside world.

What was out there? The local radio broadcasting station naturally leave out a lot of context that people would automatically know from just living there.

Sidonia elected to send Lieutenant Noguchi and Doctor Toma on a short term infiltration mission to gather information discretely up close and personal.

**Sill Silvers**

When the weather was bad, customers were dissuaded from visiting, and therefore today's a slow business day. Still pawn shop owner Sill Silver didn't close today, nor would he close on any day of the week, not even on a holiday. He hadn't have a vacation for close to five years since he opened his shop.

Truth be told, a lot of potential customers still held grudges against Faunus, and invisibly decided to not patronize his business. So much for the Faunus Rights Revolution, and the ever improving equality between faunus and humans. It wasn't surprising in the least that a significant percentage of his customers are faunus, though the majority are still humans.

For his part, Sil didn't gouge or favor any of them. Why should he made the effort for integration, however slow going, more difficult than it is?

A door bell rung.

The shopkeeper was alerted out of his thought process to the presence of two human beings in raincoat. He can hear the wet squishing sound of their boot as the rainwater dripped away from their coat.

They pulled down their hoods, and immediately he noticed the similarity between two individuals, with their pale skin, black hair, and almond eyes. They must be related to each other then.

"Good evening," the male said with a noticeable accent as he pulled out a bag of diamond encrusted jewelries. The shopkeeper couldn't place the accent. Was it's Mistral, Atlas, or Vacuo? "How much do they sell for?"

Ah, a classic mistake.

He lowballed the number to his customers, hoping that they took in the bait. The humans glanced each other and muttered a few words.

The shopkeeper was stumped. They were inscrutable. In his line of work, being able to read body languages and faces was how he makes a living. Getting a good deal was a necessary requirement if he wants to make a profit and keep himself in business.

"We think that they not good prices," the male said.

Sil scrutinized the jewelry quickly before looking up. Some were unfamiliar, but a lot wasn't. He been through a lot of them, and he knew how to recognize the bad from the good ones.

"Well, look here...those are unknown jewelries," Sil said. "Contrary to popular beliefs, unpopular jewelries don't sell well. Where did you get these?"

"They were my grandmother's heirloom, unfortunately." It was a bare-naked lie. That raised a red flag for Silver. If he brought stolen merchandise, there would be a strong possibility of police coming to take back the merchandise and he'll be out of the money that he brought.

"Oh, I got a lot of those stories. People sell them because of the desperate financial stride they're often in, sometime of their own making, sometime not. They're definitely real tragedies. But I also know when someone is lying to me. Did you steal them?" The shop owner schooled his expression and concentrated sharply on both of his customers' face.

There was a strong reaction from both of them. He could feel the sheer fury and outrage from the man, with his sibling stepping back quickly. In just a second, the humans quickly recomposed themselves.

"No," the female spoken with strong resolution. "We did not steal them."

"Your story is full of shit, but you did not steal them. I presume that you didn't come into possession using somewhat shady means."

There was no trepidation or enmity he can detect, but it seemed that they were hiding something. What in the world are those two hiding?

"Are you still considering buying them from us?"

"Yes."

Then the gentleman named his price.

"LUDICROUS!" he roared. "Look man, I am never ever going to buy it any price. It would bankrupt me."

After a couple of haggling, the siblings and the pawn shop owner finally agreed to a prize. It was a great deal, all considering, even if he needed to contact a friend to take a good look at it. No doubt it would reap a healthy profit.
