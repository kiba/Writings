# **Chapter Fifteen: Discovery Time**

**Forest 19, Vale**
**Akeno Noguchi**

Transiting was still an unpleasant affair as Akeno contemplated his growing nausea and his companion, Toma Keiko.
They just arrived in the middle of forest in a raging storm, heavy rain pelting the window, along with a thunderous storm.

"You're going to be alright, Keiko?" he said.

"Yeah..." she said.

The nausea faded away, thanks to the pill both took earlier. The lieutenant then handed out Keiko her raincoat. Luckily they weren't in their EVA. For this mission, the higher ups had decided that it would be unnecessary and that the two-person crew will have to blend in using the local stylings.

The rain didn't subsided a bit when they left the TDM and entered the side of the road. once they were a few meters away, the TDM machine disappeared into thin air, making that 'pew' sound.

"It's going to be a long walk," the lieutenant said as the duo made their way to the city.
