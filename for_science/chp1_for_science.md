I wiped the sweat from my forehead as I worked on a contraption in my garage, soldering together electronic components for part of a device that will allow me to travel between dimensions, sort of.

My rational mind knew that this wasn't possible. Nobody had the slightest idea on how to travel between different realities, even as people postulate their existence. Yet, here I am, working feverishly on a fool's bargain.

"Soldering red, blue, and green, finished!" I said, while making a crackle. I holstered the soldering iron in my toolbelt.

Then I giggled uncontrollably.

I am fucking insane.

"Time for mountain dew!" I said as I downed another ice cold can of soda. I am now one step closer to acquiring diabetes. Disgusting taste, really. I drink only coke, damn it! But now I 'liked' it, as part of the bizarre personality change.

Then I put on a wielding helmet.

I watched as my body welded together pieces of life support equipment for what seemed like eternity.

In total, I wasted about fifty thousand dollars on this trans-dimensional travel device, including pizza, soda, and tools.

I conned my girlfriend, my dad, maxed out my credit card, and taken out a mortgage. I even quit my job after compulsively lying to everyone about what I am doing.

SOMEBODY HELP ME DAMNIT!

For sure, I tried to stop myself. Even got close to turning myself in. But nothing worked.

I got the mad scientist disease.

I turned into a psuedo-scientist hollywoodized version of myself, in it for the SCIENCE! I even wore a lab-coat, for god's sake!

I didn't even want to disclose my knowledge of dimensional theory, the way real scientists are supposed to. It would net me a Nobel prize, or most likely end with me being another crank.

No, I had to keep everything secret. I had to watch for the Men in Black(TM). I had to watch for would-be heroes.

Fuck me!

Thirty-seven hours later, I finished the god damn thing. It looked like an art installation, as if an artist decided to piece together different industrial parts together to make it look cool. There's no way the machine would work.

Time to test it and prove me wrong. I flipped a switch.

To my utter dismay, it works.

"HAHAHHAHAHHAHA," I laughed. "WORLD DOMINATION STEP ONE IS COMPLETE! TO THE COLONIES!"

I dreamed up the coordinate last night. Unlike everything else, it was just an arbitrary number. Everything else was an endless stream of theories, schematics, and practical knowledge. It all made sense to me even as I doubt the validity.

Without a number, I couldn't travel to anywhere in the universe, or worse, I will be trapped in the middle of nothing.

In nothing, you became nothing, and everything about you ceased to exist, and the reality in your particular dimension re-arranged so that you were never born.

At least, that how it is supposed to work in my delusion.

But it turned out that the delusion was far more lucid than I imagined.

It pivoted and cranked, making humming noises as liquid nitrogen continued to boil.

I stepped in the machine, beaming with confidence on the outside, but dreading the outcome on the inside.

Somebody was controlling my mind and thought process, I concluded and I had no choice but to comply, even as I screamed on the inside.

In my mind, the worst case scenario would be death in this garage.

In the best scenario, help would be coming to heal my fragile mind, after destroying every trust anyone I ever cared about have in me.

The machine whirled up. Various doodas and parts rotated. I can't believe it fucking 'work'!

Then it jumped.
