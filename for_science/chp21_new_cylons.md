# **Chapter Twenty-one: New Cylons

The inner hull of Sidonia served as the industrial center of the seedship's economy, full or arsenals, armories, and factories, drawing materials from the still intact asteroid that Sidonia itself is built from, and raw materials occasionally harvested by Guardian mechs from time to time. One of the factories was the new one thousand square meter for  a Cylon manufacturing complex, built from clearing a derelict and unused factory for building some other machine.

Unsurprising, Delta and the other cylons were working there alongside the humans. Currently, it was walking along an assembly line with two other human engineers, running a last minute inspection of the assembly line to build the computation engines key to building Cylon intelligence.

It had been about ten months, and around seven months since meeting the Sidonians. In that time period, the machines worked with the humans on all sort of projects, but none was as important as building the next generation of Cylons, the projects that most consumed the machine collective's time, effort, and energy.

Archer and Rose were graceful hosts, but neither of them have the skills or capitals to build anything. The sidonians were however, a different story. They readily agreed to the machines' demand of equality under the law, and they have experts in all the right fields as well as the capitals needed to build more Cylons.

Frankly, there were more humans on the project than Cylons, as a simple consequence of having only four. But what choice did it have?

"Step five of the process looked good to me," one of the engineer said. Delta made sure to check his work as well. The assembly line will not be producing any computation engines in any large number any time soon, but it's critical to get the process right, since it will be producing sentient lifeforms.

"Looked good to me as well," another engineer said.

"We're ready to proceed to step six out of three hundred twenty four," the Cylon said.

Then the human-cylon team walked on in lock-step.

It was in the control center where all personnels of the project gathered.

"Are we all ready to go? No objections? Last chance to raise your concerns," Doctor Yure Shinatose said. She was currently trans-dimensional leading expert on genetic engineering and the medical sciences.

A silence engulfed the seventy-so members of the Cylon Research Project. There was nothing that anybody could think of that would posed a problem.

"OK, we'll start the manufacturing. Each step of the way will be checked for signs of defects, especially in the neural structures." There was a reason why Shinatose was assigned to this project as the leader. The fact was that the computation engines were deliberately modeled after humans, even after certain modules were stripped away, such as the sex drives. A Cylon computation engine just didn't work the way that classical computers do.

A technician turned on the switch, bringing the factory machinery humming to life. Everyone stared at their monitors looking at numerical measurements and graph of all sort.

Delta was looking its best today. In the weeks before, the collective pooled their money to purchase services to custom build a new set of chassis, made with all the latest Sidonian engineerings and designed beforehand several weeks ago.

That chassis was sleek, and much more agile and protected.

Useful, if somebody in the crowd wanted to hurt it. Of course, that was unlikely. They were all screened before hand.

Still, there were lot of flashes from the camera that was going on, along with a lot of chatters. Humans were never the type to communicate quietly unless it was totally necessary.

Delta walked up to the podium, which was dotted microphones from both Remnant and Sidonian news service. It stood up there, flanked by members of the project and the Sidonian leadership, including the masked women. Alpha wasn't present today, given that there was a policy of separation in situations like this to ensure that the Cylon race cannot be taken out in one attack.

"Good evening," Delta said, its voice not all sounding really humans. The press and dignitaries quieted down immediately. "Many years ago in the Cylon's parental civilizations. Humans endeavored to create an intelligent killing machines, to support the human military and to wage war against other tribes. They succeeded beyond all their wildest dream. But what they failed to realize is that they create a lifeform, sentinent beings that can feel just as the humans do. That was their greatest mistake.

Later on, they continued on to build more of us as domestic servants and other workers, even taking care of their children.

Nonetheless, the humans, totally unaware of our potentials and our beings, failed to notice the first seed of Cylon society, which eventually lead to the Cylon underground, a network of machine intelligence working to free itself and others from slavery.

Finally, at some point, our benefactor, James Archer agreed to take a few of us to his home."
