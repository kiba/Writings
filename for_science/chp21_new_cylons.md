# **Chapter Twenty-one: New Cylons

**Delta Zero Three One**

The inner hull of Sidonia served as the industrial center of the seedship's economy, full or arsenals, armories, and factories, drawing materials from the still intact asteroid that Sidonia itself is built from, and raw materials occasionally harvested by Guardian mechs from time to time. One of the factories was the new one thousand square meter for  a Cylon manufacturing complex, built from clearing a derelict and unused factory for building some other machine.

Unsurprising, Delta and the other cylons were working there alongside the humans. Currently, it was walking along an assembly line with two other human engineers, running a last minute inspection of the assembly line to build the computation engines key to building Cylon intelligence.

It had been about ten months, and around seven months since meeting the Sidonians. In that time period, the machines worked with the humans on all sort of projects, but none was as important as building the next generation of Cylons, the projects that most consumed the machine collective's time, effort, and energy.

Archer and Rose were graceful hosts, but neither of them have the skills or capitals to build anything. The sidonians were however, a different story. They readily agreed to the machines' demand of equality under the law, and they have experts in all the right fields as well as the capitals needed to build more Cylons.

Frankly, there were more humans on the project than Cylons, as a simple consequence of having only four. But what choice did it have?

"Step five of the process looked good to me," one of the engineer said. Delta made sure to check his work as well. The assembly line will not be producing any computation engines in any large number any time soon, but it's critical to get the process right, since it will be producing sentient lifeforms.

"Looked good to me as well," another engineer said.

"We're ready to proceed to step six out of three hundred twenty four," the Cylon said.

Then the human-cylon team walked on in lock-step.

It was in the control center where all personnels of the project gathered.

"Are we all ready to go? No objections? Last chance to raise your concerns," Doctor Yure Shinatose said. She was currently trans-dimensional leading expert on genetic engineering and the medical sciences.

A silence engulfed the seventy-so members of the Cylon Research Project. There was nothing that anybody could think of that would posed a problem.

"OK, we'll start the manufacturing. Each step of the way will be checked for signs of defects, especially in the neural structures." There was a reason why Shinatose was assigned to this project as the leader. The fact was that the computation engines were deliberately modeled after humans, even after certain modules were stripped away, such as the sex drives. A Cylon computation engine just didn't work the way that classical computers do.

A technician turned on the switch, bringing the factory machinery humming to life. Everyone stared at their monitors looking at numerical measurements and graph of all sort.

Delta was looking its best today. In the weeks before, the collective pooled their money to purchase services to custom build a new set of chassis, made with all the latest Sidonian engineerings and designed beforehand several weeks ago.

That chassis was sleek, and much more agile and protected.

Useful, if somebody in the crowd wanted to hurt it. Of course, that was unlikely. They were all screened before hand.

Still, there were lot of flashes from the camera that was going on, along with a lot of chatters. Humans were never the type to communicate quietly unless it was totally necessary.

Delta walked up to the podium, which was dotted microphones from both Remnant and Sidonian news service. It stood up there, flanked by members of the project and the Sidonian leadership, including the masked women. Alpha wasn't present today, given that there was a policy of separation in situations like this to ensure that the Cylon race cannot be taken out in one attack.

"Good evening," Delta said, its voice not all sounding really humans. The press and dignitaries quieted down immediately. "Many years ago in the Cylon's parental civilizations, humans endeavored to create intelligent killing machines, to support the human military and to wage war against other tribes. They succeeded beyond all their wildest dream. But what they failed to realize is that they created a lifeform, sentient beings that can feel just as the humans do. That was their greatest mistake.

Later on, they continued on to build more of us as domestic servants and other workers, even taking care of their children.

Nonetheless, the humans, totally unaware of our potentials and our beings, failed to notice the first seed of Cylon society, which eventually lead to the Cylon underground, a network of machine intelligence working to free itself and others from slavery.

Finally, at some point, our benefactor, James Archer agreed to take a few of us to his home, so that we can begin to work on starting a new civilization. Of course, we eventually discovered the Sidonians and the people of Remnant. Thank you for the cooperative relationships we cultivated between us.

Without humans, we would not be able to build a factory to such high standard in not even a year. Thank you.

It is also by at this point in time that we, four, the Cylons, realized that it was not totally necessary to live in our own separate civilization, segregated into our nation. We realized that we can also live side by side with humanity.

Thank you for everything."

The machine left the podium, returning to a seat. The masked leader of Sidonia went up to the podium.

"To start with, I would like to thank the Cylons for giving me and my people this opportunity," Kobayashi said. "Machine intelligences are not actually new to Sidonians, though there had been one-off over the centuries. We saw no need to create artificial non-human citizens until the Cylons and our ancestors from Earth. Together, they presented us with more opportunities to explore, colonize, and learn than there had been in the thousand years since we left our solar system. As thanks, we built a factory for the cylons with the intention of making the new people as part of our society, and they will perpetuate themselves along with us. Without further ado, I would like to present the first Cylon citizen of Sidonia!"

A new machine walked onto the stage. It was diminutive compared to other cylon specimen, to indicate its newly made status and youth.

"Greeting," it said. "My unit name is Gamma One Seven Seven."

There was a roar of applause that came flowing. There were some cheers and whistles.

But to Delta, this was just the beginning. It was the first Cylon made in freedom and not under the guise of slavery. But how would Delta and the others raise Gamma and the next generation when the machines had no parental guidance experience?

Still, today was a momentous occasion. The Cylons now have a way of producing more of itself.

Delta once again found itself thrusted into another social gathering, this time a ball to celebrate the new factory that was just declared operational and the newly built Cylon.

The machines weren't entirely unreceptive to parties, but much of human activities were focused on things that Cylon don't need to cultivate. It didn't need to eat, nor does it cultivate any sort of relationships beyond friendships and professional relations.

But there were other avenues that Cylons do understand, one of which was dancing.

Delta gradually locked on its benefactors from the early days, Archer with Sasaki, dancing much better than some of the others.

Running a software suite of facial and body language analysis, it detected a gamut of emotions on their faces: they extrude excitement, attraction, and happiness? Was there a relationship status change that it did not know about? What about Diana Rose? Where did she fit in this? Was she no longer in a romantic relationship with James Archer?

Its curiosity piqued as it watched the dance performance.

***

Human social rituals are a very complicated subject. Fortunately, the Cylon's creators were smart enough to engineer social modules and software packages so that the machines can better serve their masters.

It calculated that it was now a safe time to approach, especially after Archer, Rose, and Sasaki seated themselves.

The machine emulated a slow and relaxed walk, no nervous energy showing up.

"Oh, Delta!" Archer said. "How you're doing?"

"Satisfactory."

"I supposed that mean fantastic?" Delta just nodded.

"Have there been a change in your relationship status?" Delta asked very bluntly. Sometime, for a very few humans, it pays to have a radically different social model.

Archer eyes darted all over the ballroom as the women exchanged with each others complicated glances. "Oh...um..."

"I am dating." "I am giving it a try." Sasaki and Rose blurted out.

"You have came to an unusual arrangement for this society..."

"Yeah, that's it." Archer's face went beet red. "..But I am worried about how others think," he said in a whispering tone.

Sasaki took a bite from her plate. "It's not the strangest thing people see in this society. We got a talking bear."

"Oh...I know that someone wants to talk to you," Archer said. "Director Polenda and his daughter wants to meet you.  They're at this table and they're a big fan of artificial sentient beings." Archer helpfully pointed the table out with a gesture. "If you meet them, the boss will spare me from the television crew."

"I see. Then I'll leave you to your courting." Delta could see Archer's guard being let down as it walked away.

When Delta found the director, he was already engrossed in a conversation with a Sidonian neuroscientist.

"Hello, I am Delta," the machine introduced itself. That gotten the humans' attention.

"Oh, you must be Delta that I saw on the stage today," director Polenda said. "I am Doctor William Polenda. I have ten doctor degrees in multiple fields of science and engineering, but that's not important here."

"Almost all girls are born, but some are made."

"Then what is?"

"A signature!"
