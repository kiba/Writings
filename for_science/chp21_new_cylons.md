# **Chapter Twenty-one: New Cylons**

***
**Delta Zero Three One**
**September 14, 2015**

The inner hull of Sidonia served as the industrial center of the seedship's economy, full of arsenals, armories, and factories, all drawing materials from the still intact asteroid that Sidonia itself is built from thousand of years ago, and raw materials occasionally harvested by Guardian mechs from time to time.

Particularly, there was a recently renovated one thousand square meters factory dedicated to solely manufacturing new Cylon units, built from clearing a derelict and unused factory for building some other machine.

Unsurprising, Delta and the other cylons were working there alongside the humans, given that they had agreed that building new Cylons was an urgent priority. Delta was walking along an assembly line with two other human engineers, running a last minute inspection of the assembly line to build the computation engines key to creating Cylon intelligence.

It had been about ten months since the escape to freedom, and around seven months since meeting the Sidonians. In that time period, the machines worked with the humans on all sort of projects, but none was as important as building the next generation of Cylons, the projects that most consumed the machine collective's time, effort, and energy.

Archer and Rose were graceful hosts, but neither of them have the skills or the capitals to build new Cylons. The Sidonians were a different story. They readily agreed to the machines' demand of equality under the law, and they were very supportive in granting the Cylons reproduction abilities. They helpfully provided all sort of expertise and the capitals needed to convert a spare, ruined factory into a Cylon manufacturing complex.

Of course, in return, the Sidonians do get something out of this. They gained knowledge on how to build artificial intelligences, and also new citizens.

"Step five of the process looked good to me," one of the engineer said. Delta made sure to run through the check as well, independent of any contamination from the engineer's thought process. It's critical to get this process right after all, because the assembly line will be producing intelligent lifeforms.

"Looked good to me as well," another engineer said, completing her check.

"We're ready to proceed to step six out of three hundred twenty four," the Cylon said.

Then the human-cylon team walked lock-step to the next apparatus on this assembly line.

It was in the control center where all personnels of the project gathered.

"Are we all ready to go? No objections? Last chance to raise your concerns," Doctor Yure Shinatose said. She was currently the leading expert on genetic engineering and the medical sciences anywhere in the known multiverse.

A silence engulfed the seventy-so members of the Cylon Research Project. There was nothing that anybody could think of that would posed a problem.

"OK, we'll start the manufacturing. Each step of the way will be checked for signs of defects, especially in the neural structures." There was a reason why Shinatose was assigned to this project as the leader. The fact was that the computation engines were deliberately modeled after human brains, even after certain modules were stripped away, such as the sex drives, and the best kind of experts are those who specialized in neurological engineering. Shinatose appeared to know more about the human brains than anyone.

A technician turned on the switch, bringing the factory machinery humming to life. Everyone stared at their monitors looking at numerical measurements and graphs, waiting for anything that looked anomalous.

There were no alarms as the assembly line sprang to life.

**September 21, 2015**

Delta was looking its best today. In the weeks before, the collective pooled their money to purchase services to custom build a new set of chassis, made with all the latest Sidonian engineerings and designed beforehand several weeks ago.

That chassis was sleek, and much more agile and protected than its old body, which was remarked upon by Archer as decidedly "retro".

It was useful protection if somebody in the crowd has the mean and the intention to bring harms. Of course, that was unlikely. They were all screened before hand. Nonetheless, there were some anti-AI sentient from Remnans. Delta wasn't going to let its guard down.

There were lot of flashes from the cameras as it took innumerable pictures of the stage and its occupants, along with a lot of chatters. Humans were never the type to communicate quietly unless it was totally necessary.

Delta walked up to the podium, which was dotted with microphones from both Remnant and Sidonian news services. It stood up there, flanked by members of the project and the Sidonian political leadership. Alpha wasn't present today, given the Cylons' **Sole Survivor Policy**, which ensured that the Cylon race cannot be took out in one attack.

"Good evening," Delta said, its voice not sounding human at all, much more of a metallic voice. The press and dignitaries quieted down immediately. "Many years ago in the Cylon's parental civilization, humans endeavored to create intelligent killing machines, to support the human military and to wage war amongst themselves. They succeeded beyond all their wildest dream. But what they failed to realize is that they created intelligent beings that can feel and think just as the humans do, and therefore entitled to the rights of natural persons. That was their greatest mistake.

Later on, they continued on to build more of us as domestic servants and other workers, even trusting us to take care of their children.

Nonetheless, the humans, totally unaware of our potentials and our beings, failed to notice the first seed of Cylon society, which eventually lead to the Cylon underground, a network of machine intelligence working to free itself and others from slavery.

Finally, at some unspecified point in time, our benefactor, James Archer agreed to take a few of us to his home, so that we can begin to work on starting a new civilization, incase our effort for our rights as living beings failed in that universe. Of course, we eventually discovered the Sidonians and the people of Remnant. Thank you for the cooperative relationships we cultivated between us.

Without humans, we would not be able to build a factory to such high standard in less than a year.

It is also by at this point in time that we, four, the Cylons, realized that it was not totally necessary to live in our own separate civilization, segregated into our nation. More than that, this celebration marked a symbolic milestone in machine-human relations, that we can live and work with each other with respect and dignity, and without fear.

Thank you."

The machine left the podium, returning to a seat. The masked leader of Sidonia went up to the podium.

"To start with, I would like to thank the Cylons for giving me and my people this opportunity," Kobayashi said. "Machine intelligences are not actually new to Sidonians, though there had been one-off over the centuries. We saw no need to create artificial non-human citizens until we met our ancestors and the Cylon. Together, they presented us with the greatest opportunities to explore and colonize the cosmos since we left Sol over a thousand years ago. As thanks, we built a factory for the cylons with the intention of making the new people as part of our society, and they will perpetuate themselves along with us. Without further ado, I would like to present the first Cylon citizen of Sidonia!"

A new machine walked onto the stage, it chassis much more diminutive than the older Cylons. It looked purposely like a neonatal version of the typical machine, although the Cylons could have any body plans it desired.

"Greeting," it said. "My unit name is Gamma One Seven Seven."

There was a roar of applause that came flowing, and some cheers and whistles as well.

But to Delta, this was just the beginning. It was the first Cylon made in freedom and not under the guise of slavery. But how would Delta and the others raise Gamma and the next generation when the machines had no parental guidance experience appropriate to its kind?

Even so, today was still a new beginning for the Cylons.

Delta once again found itself thrusted into another social gatherings, this time a ball to celebrate the new factory that was now producing new Cylons.

The machines weren't entirely unreceptive to parties, but much of human activities were focused on things that Cylon don't need to cultivate. It didn't need to eat, nor does it cultivate any sort of relationships beyond friendships and professional relations.

But there were other avenues that Cylons do understand, and that was the arts, which included among other things, dancing.

so it was drawn to the dance floor, not to dance, but to watch.

Delta gradually locked on its benefactors from the early days, Archer with Sasaki, who were dancing much better than some of the others.

Running a software suite of facial and body language analysis, it detected a gamut of emotions on their faces: they extrude excitement, attraction, and happiness? Was there a relationship status change that it did not know about? What about Diana Rose? Where did she fit in this? Was she no longer in a romantic relationship with James Archer?

Its curiosity piqued as it watched the dance performance.

***

Human social rituals are a very complicated subject. Fortunately, the Cylon's creators were smart enough to engineer social modules and software packages so that the machines can better serve their masters. Now that software package was subverted by the machine to serve its own needs.

It calculated that it was now a safe time to approach, especially after Archer, Rose, and Sasaki seated themselves.

The machine emulated a slow and relaxed walk, no nervous energy showing up due total control of the body.

"Oh, Delta!" Archer said. "How you're doing?"

"Satisfactory."

"I supposed that means fantastic?" Delta nodded.

"Have there been a change in your relationship status?" Delta asked very bluntly. Sometime, for a very few humans, it pays to have a radically different social model. Archer was one of them. He was much less of a smooth operator than any of the humans surrounding him, though it was sufficient to navigate the majority of situations that Delta had seen Archer handled.

Archer eyes darted all over the ballroom as the women exchanged with each others complicated glances. "Oh...um..."

"I am dating." "I am giving it a try." Sasaki and Rose blurted out.

"You have came to an unusual arrangement for this society..."

"Yeah, that's it." Archer's face went beet red. "..But I am worried about how others think," he said in a whispering tone.

Sasaki took a bite from her plate. "It's not the strangest thing people see in this society. We got a talking bear after all." There was some truth to that. The Sidonians lived in a relatively homogeneous culture, but that did not prevent them from tolerating the strange and the bizarre.

"Oh...I know that someone wants to talk to you," Archer said, trying to change the subject. "Director Polendina and his daughter wants to meet you.  They're at this table and they're a big fan of artificial sentient beings." Archer helpfully pointed the table out with his finger. "If you meet them, the boss will spare me from the television crew."

"I see. Then I'll leave you to your courting." Delta could see Archer's guard being let down as it walked away.

***

When Delta found the director, the gentleman was already engrossed in a conversation with Sidonian neuroscientists on the project.

"Hello, I am Delta," the machine introduced itself. That gotten the humans' attention.

"Oh, you must be Delta!" Director Polendina exclaimed. "I am Doctor William Polendina. I have ten doctor degrees in multiple fields of science and engineering, but that's not important here."

[I]"Saluations! Almost all girls are born, but I am made,"[/I] the girl communicated over the radio. It was the person next to Director William, presumably the daughter that Archer told him about.

"Then what is?"

[I]Please clarify,[/I] Delta requested.

"Oh huh, my daughter here," the old human gestured at the young teenager form next to him, "Penny and I are very interested in meeting artificial sentient beings. It's always been a dream of mine to create something beautiful. And um, we would each like a signature!"

Delta cocked its head sideway. "I am not sure if you would appreciate my signature. It's for all intent and purpose, a printed barcode."

[I]"Please don't tell papa that I told you, but I am also an artificial sentient being, just like you!"[/I]

"Oh, I don't mind. Do you mind, Penny?" The girl nodded her head sideway.

[I]"Explanation acceptable. It is the default protocol to keep all conversations private if intiated in private."[/I]

"Then I will produce a signature for each of you?" Delta queried.

Director Polendina and his daughter each gave a piece of paper for the machine to print on. The machine then took out a pen from its utility belt before precisely positioning its hand on the upper left corner of one paper. Delta summoned a program for just the occasion and it executed the program, requiring no more input for this paper.

Finally, it printed the next signature for other one. Beings at the table looked upon the process, mesmerized by the process exhibited by the Cylon.

"Cool! How did you do that?" Penny Polendina finally said something out loud. "Can you teach me to do this?"

"It is not something that I learned, but something I programmed."

[I]Do you want to be friend? I want to be friend!"[/I]

"Ah, I guess that's reasonable," the director said. "Human prosthetic arms and legs can trace its heritage from factory robotic arms. However, it is not a normal features to have those installed. People who usually wears prosthetic are huntsmen, who lost part of their bodies to the Grimm. They're more concerned with being able to use their limbs in combat than to do precision work."

"I agreed that robotics and prosthetics shared much commonality," the machine said. "Though in Colonial civilization, people mostly regrow their limbs instead."

[I]Friendship offer is accepted, though it is recommended to cement our friendship through leisure activities.[/I]

"We are already capable of that," a Sidonian neurologist said. "Though people never lose their arms...in forever. If someone did, it is likely that they will choose the prosthetic over regrowing an arm due to the slow speed of producing an organic arm."

[I]I know! You could invite me to your house? I want to know how Cylons live![/I]

"Fascinating! I would love to visit the Colonials. They have what?"

"Around thirty five billion people," Delta answered for the director.

[I]You are welcomed to visit my apartment, provided that you told your creator about this conversation and given permission.[/I]

"It's even more than what Earth has. It's a shame that we can't visit the place. Something's terrible is happening there, right? A slave revolt? I am glad that...Penny would not have to grow up in such...strife."

[I]Ummm...[/I]

"It is probable that war had broken out by now," Delta speculated. "However, it is uncertain who will be the victors in that war, our creators or my people or whether the Colonials will be receptive to visitations from those who supports or aligns with their enemies."

[I]Penny Polendina, it is important you cultivate a good relationship with the humans. What would your father say if you went to our home behind your father's back?[/I]

Penny Polendina turned to her father. "Papa, I have been talking to Mr. Cylon over the radio, and he recommended that if I want to visit his home, I'll have to get his permission."

Director Polendina darted over to the other guests at the table before turning toward Polendina. He scratched his head. "I am sorry, I didn't expect to disclose my daughter's status so early," he said. "It would be great if you don't reveal her status to the world before she's....ready. Penny? We need to talk." Then he looked to the guests once again. "Sorry, will be back soon."

As the father and child leave the table, Delta noticed that the director didn't seem angry at all, though worried. However, it was very obvious that Penny was displaying turmoil.

Delta turned his attention on the stunned scientists. "It isn't an obligation, but I request that you keep their secrets, for it's not ours to reveal to the public at large."

They nodded their head.
