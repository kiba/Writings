# **Chapter Twenty-one: New Cylons

The inner hull of Sidonia served as an industrial sector, full or arsenals, armories, and factories, drawing materials from the still intact asteroid that Sidonia itself is built from, and raw materials occasionally harvested from time to time. One of the factories was the new one thousand square meter for  a Cylon manufacturing complex, built from clearing a delirchit and unused factory for building some other machine. 

It had been about ten months, and around seven months since meeting the Sidonians. In that time period, the machines worked with the humans on all sort of projects, but none was as important as building the next generation of Cylons, the projects that most consumed the machine collective's time, effort, and energy.

Archer and Rose were graceful hosts, but neither of them have the skills or capitals to build anything. The sidonians were however, a different story. They readily agreed to the machines' demand of equality under the law, and they have experts in all the right fields as well as the capitals needed to build more Cylons.

Frankly, there were more humans on the project than Cylons, as a simple consequence of having only four. But what choice did it have?
