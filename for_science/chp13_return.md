# **Chapter 13: Return**

***
## **Delta Zero One Three**

When the humans jumped into an unknown reality, they left the Delta to its own device, trusting it to handle the Archer/Rose household until they return.

This unit was mildly concerned about the unnecessary risks taken.

Even so, it continued its task of making money for the household managing the bills. Algorithmic trading revenue continued to increase as more capital became available.

But by the end of that one week, the humans had yet to return.

This unit became moderately concerned.

Yet the humans and Delta did talk out this particular scenario, more so with Diana Rose than James Archer, its original benefactor.

So, it gifted itself more autonomy and built bodies for the other cylons, abandoning the plans to build a proper body. This took serious engineering labor as it worked to interface Earth electronics with Colonial. But when it was finished, three other cylons were milling about. They were the other volunteers.

Alpha One Niner Three, Beta Eight Four Three, and Charles Nine Nine Four were now active, carrying out the tasks of managing the household while engaging in the robotic engineering.

By doing so, the machine had staved off panic for the second week.

Week three passed by, and the collective cylons were now very worried. The humans still did not return. In response, they begun brainstorming elaborate and complex decision trees for their plan, collecting knowledge from the internet and taking it into account.

The collective decided three months was the cut-off limit, especially if the humans did not return. From there, it should be prepared to contact the outside world, complete with recording and safewords.

But that would be the worst case scenario.

***
**April 27, 2015.**

It had been almost two months since he arrived in this universe, about two weeks ago that the other Cylons had became active, and three weeks since the humans took off.

The most dominating emotion was 'worried'.

The machine, grateful to Archer, stood by the entrance into the garage, waiting. That what it was mostly doing in its free time between engineering projects and trading.

Income level was at twelves thousand dollars and increasing. Engineering projects are proceeding at full clip, though deadline estimates were revised constantly for later dates. No suspicious activities were noted outside the house.

But that did not avail Delta with any confidence. It would be a worst case scenario if the three month deadline was passed. It meant that something went horribly wrong in some other universe and that they are unlikely to return.

Since it was unable to enjoy activities of any kind, the machine found itself standing near the garage, waiting for the humans to come back. The other units were unaffected, due to the lack of personal interaction with the humans.

In the past, the machine felt anger and rage at its human slavemasters.

Now it felt an overwhelming concern and anxiety that cannot be smothered.

Suddenly, there was a pew sound, causing it to feel hopes.

But then hope immediately turned to alarm and confusion. It didn't panic, for there was no such reactions possible with their physiology.

It leveled its makeshift battleaxe for a possible incursion.

Suddenly, the door opened up to someone in a suit.

"Identify yourself!" Delta said.

"The eagle has landed," the familiar voice said. It was a safephase, signifying that he was not under coercion. Two humans in suits exited the trans-dimensional machine.

The machine noticed that the redhead female looked different from the beginning of the month.

"What happened to Miss Rose?"

"She's staying with them. This is, um...hos"

"Guest. Please to greet you, I will be in your share. My name is Sasaki, and I am the chief engineer of Sidonia."

"We came to an agreement about the exchange of knowledge and technology, an agreement that I am initially displeased with...but..."

The woman smiled. "It all worked out."

There's something that the human wasn't telling him. Perhaps Delta will need to talk to him in private and then inform the collective via laser comms.

"Perhaps you will regal us about the tales of your....adventure some time soon."

"Believe me, there's nothing interesting, in the Chinese sense of the word that went on."

"Pardon?"

"Dangerous or turbulent time."

***

The machine did not like what it heard. At the earliest possibility, it separated James Archer from the guest so that it could talk to him privately, though there was a possibly that the new woman was spying on them through methods unknown, which was why the Cylon collective constructed a Faraday cage in an unused closet.

"Despite your use of the safephase, you had been...coerced..."

"I know, I know, but it's-"

"And you're showing signs of Stockholm syndrome."

The human pursed his lips. "Which was why Sasaki is a hostage, despite her insistence as a guest."

"She was probably chosen to ingratiate with you and to smooth over relations, washing away the sin of slavery and coercion."

"It's not slavery."

"And espionage."

"It's what nations do."

"I am not impressed by your excuses for their actions and I will inform my fellow machines of the situation we found ourselves in and relay your story."

"Please don't start a war."

"In our position, it would only end badly. Nonetheless, we shall seek redress from Sidonia to declaw their hold on you and Diana Rose, regardless of their moral reasoning for subjugating you."

The male sighed. "You're right. But how will you do that?"

"You will demand more information and knowledge from this Sasaki than you give back. Be stingy."

"That's going to be hard to do with Sasaki. She's fun to talk to."

"You would undermine our interest in this matters. Take care, and one of us will negotiate a more generous settlement to compensate for the grievance."

"Fine."

With that, the machine walked out with a quiet anger. Yet, it realized that working with the Sidonians could bring a beneficial outcome. A point in their favor was that they did not bring much unnecessary suffering and that they showed hospitality.

Yet, they admitted outright that they wanted Archer's technologies and are unwilling to let him go. Why did they gave their advantages away when they could try to lie?

Then there was Archer's mental condition and his reckless exploration. In retrospect, the machine shouldn't condone his actions and pressed for a more cautious approach. Look where it got the humans.

## **Chief Engineer Sasaki**

Sasaki was becoming irate. James was instructed to not be generous to her and Sidonia. Yet, she could see their point of view. The captain's negotiation backfired, all in to secure trans-dimensional travel technology.

They could be nice, and it could work out. There was no guarantee, however. The captain took a risk and it predictably angered someone on the opposing side.

"Well, what can I do?" she said rhetorically. "It wasn't our finest moment."

"I am glad you understand," the other engineer said.

"Trust me, I completely do. But what's done is done, and I'll take one of them to Sidonia in the next three days or so, as per our agreement."

There will be another set of negotiation and meeting as demanded by the machine.

"And what about learning?"

"I'll keep teaching, because it's in my interest to do so."

**April 29th, 2015**

"AIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEE" Sasaki screamed as she held a death grip on the seat in James's car. The cars, while orderly and neat, were too close to Sasaki for comfort.

"How the fuck you don't get killed???!!!"

James laughed. "We don't. I believed it's in the top ten cause of death for my age group?"

Sasaki closed her eyes tightly. "You...ancients...are crazy!"

Finally, James parked near a bookstore and a coffeeshop. "We're here." Sasaki sobbed a little in relief.

"It's the most dangerous activity I have to undertake everyday, but unfortunately it's unavoidable." Sasaki let out a litany of colorful curses in response.

She finally settled herself when they entered the coffeeshop, which was air conditioned relative to the hot outside.

"Those Korean Americans are always studying something," James delved into the demographic of the coffeeshop, explaining the various type of customers that came into the shop.

Quickly, they settled on a big and empty table, getting out laptops, workbooks, and office supplies. Sasaki was still tutoring James and getting him up to date.

***

**Three hours later**

Heigus particles were energy fields that permeated throughout the universe, serving as an infinite source of energy, allowing technological civilizations to effectively cheat entropy.

Sasaki was worried that electronics and equipments would malfunction when they cross universes, but it didn't seem to be the case.

It became her job, then, to tutor her hosts, including the Cylon in the science and engineering applications of the Heigus particles.

Which was why she ended up here in this cafe/bookstore watching over James focusing intensely on his coursework.

When he finished his coursework, he should be definitely be capable of constructing a crude but effective Heigus generator. From there, he should be able to conduct research and develop the technology independent of Sidonia. Of course, from there on, Sasaki will instruct him further so that he didn't have to replicate what Sidonia knows from scratch.

"YOU!" a voice exclaimed.

"Excuse me?" Sasaki said to the pudgy man that shown up. He looked very visibly angry. It seemed that it wasn't any of his friends that James mentioned.

"What? Oh no," Archer said. "Rose's ex."

"You, James Archer, stole my girlfriend."

"That was after that she broke off with you." Archer stood up from his chair. "And I am trying to work some new physics here."

"Oh yeah? Fancying yourself a theoretical physicist?"

Archer scoffed. "McKay, you know I am not capable of that shit. Well I am, but I preferred making stuff."

"I have let you know that Rodney McKay is perfectly capable of mechanical engineering. I am capable of making stuff."

"Look. You ain't going to win her back just because you have a greater mental chop than I do. So go feel superior and smug somewhere else."

"Mr. Rodney McKay?" a voice said. It looked to be the store manager.

"What?"

McKay walked off to talk to the manager.

"What was all that about?" Sasaki asked.

"No idea. But it looked like Doctor McKay wasn't having a good time. Last time I heard, he was supposed to be working for the military. Maybe his attitude problem got the best of him."

"Why?"

"He's an arrogant asshole, likes to think he's smarter than anyone in the room, and he is."
