I stirred from my sleep.

There was...comfort?

The air was warm and my hands and feet are certainly not freezing.

I was also in a comfy bed, covered by blankets, in what appeared to be a wooden cabin. Not that I know, since I am a city-boy. I am not the sort of adventurous person who camps after all.

"You appear to be awake..." a monotonous voice said.

I turned my head, confused. "What?" I asked, not understanding.

"Do you understand me?" it asked.

Who the hell am I looking at? Why is he in some sort of costume?

Wait...this is an alternate reality after all, and they're speaking an entirely different language! I think?

FUCK!

"Do you understand me?" it repeated in another language.

And then another and another.

I only became more confused, because I couldn't understand a god damn thing nor could I pinpoint the language it was using.

Finally, after it stopped for after like twelve or thirteen time, it stood up and walked gracefully to the fridge. It then fetched some food and put it in the microwave.

That was amazing. I mean it seriously. Years of working with robots reinforced the expectation that they aren't capable of those sort of stuff, especially if they aren't humans dressing up as robots. I think they are robots, not humans.

For one, it stood completely still. Actually, that was the only evidence that I have. Only gut instinct told me that they were robots, not humans. I could be wrong.

It was a hamburger, or this Earth's version of the hamburger.

"Eat," it said in the same monotonous voice. It was either incredible acting or that they're really machines. Maybe they're remote controlled.

I experimentally reached out and grabbed it, then with reluctance, I took a bite.

It was good. It had an unfamiliar texture, but still tasty all the same. I could say that this is a different version of Earth's hamburger. I wasn't going to throw up, I hoped.

But I was in a room filled with machines. I think they are androids or robots, maybe owned by somebody?

Or maybe they are robot citizens who lived in a society filled with humans. After all, machines don't need to eat. They need gears, motors, and oils, but not organic materials we humans called food.

Once I finished, I asked, "got any more?"

It just stood there, rolling its eye back and forth, saying nothing.

"Communication failure," it said. "Communication not possible. Language not in database."

I sighed. Maybe there wasn't any seconds. Anyway, I stayed quiet, saying nothing, and waiting for the robot to take the lead.

After staying motionless for sometime, it approached me and extended my hand. I took its hand, trusting it not to kill me.

I was led to the outside world.

Immediately, I noticed seven more robots, all with the same identical make and model, surrounded by nature. If this was a set, then it's a incredible well hidden one.

I noticed something else. there's no way a human could fit inside any of those bodies, unless they were midgets. That narrowed it down to remote control bots or actual bots.

"Hi guys? Please don't kill me?" I pleaded.
