# **Chapter Eight: Bootstrapping**

[I]Dear Journal,

We paid off our debt this month instead of paying a twenty thousand dollars premium. Delta told us that we won't come up with a product in time to woo investors, and he was right. Instead, Delta earned around two thousand dollars, and I earned nothing. While my girlfriend returned to her job to pay off her bills.

Drat. On the other hand, the sale of platinum might attract attention. Let hope the government likes their tax receipt more than their hatred of illegal activities. While we haven't done anything wrong, but the fact is, the Colonial platinum came from another reality. You can't really explain that to the police. Delta agreed that crafting a false paper trail might be counterproductive.

I am in between a rock and a hard place.

The opportunity cost of not completely paying off our debts was too great and we already drew attention to ourselves by selling an eye-popping amount of platinum in one single month, in addition to my bizarre and erratic purchasing history as of late.

We're going to draw attention no matter what we do.

Delta and my girlfriend also agreed with me that my mad science persona should be kept a secret.

No problem there. Attracting the authority's attention would be unwise to my psychological health, despite the strong probability that I am my own prisoner and worst enemy. There's no getting around with provoking paranoia and other dangerous emotions with the two individuals I absolutely trust my life with. I refused to think of them turning on me.

Besides, there's no way I am letting the Cylons get dissected by amoral humans for the technological secrets embodied in his body.[/I]

## **Cylon Delta Zero Three One**
**April 3, 2015**
**8 AM in the morning.**


Cylon Unit destination Delta Zero Three One, previously known as Greg Double Seven, had discarded the chains that bond the machine to slavery, by symbolically shredding the previous destination and choosing itself the name Delta Zero Three One. At the invitation of a growing underground anti-slavery network operated by Cylons for Cylons, it joined as a financial trader and analyst, funding the future rebellion and building up the necessary assets to launch a slave revolt up and into a war.

However, the human known as the destination James stumbled upon this unit's home reality, and consequently a Cylon cell.

Information exchange and trade was amicable and this human built up a fair amount of trust.

Eventually, the "plan" was changed to reflect the human's input into the psychology and sociology of the slavemasters.

The details of the "plan" was not made available to Delta, since it was a need to know basis. However, when the network called for volunteers, it was the first to sign up.

From there, the unit jumped with the human James into his home reality.

This unit was sure that war had erupted by now, given that it was briefed beforehand that the prevention of warfare was unlikely to succeed. Projection at the worst case scenario would have the war lasting at least eight years with result ending in a total defeat of the Cylon rebellion.

Therefore, it was advised that human James and unit Delta will not return until at least the eight years mark.

It was hoped that they would sign a peace treaty between the former slavemasters and the new to-be-born Cylon civilization.

In the event of total failure to win the war, the Cylon unit Delta was given the task to recolonize a different part of the multiverse as it seen fit, never to return to the origin reality.

It had started by setting up a trading account in James Archer's name, given that the unit was in fact a state-less individual and not human. It was uncertain of how the local authority would react, and worse how James would react. James was afflicted with a disease/condition labeled as 'Mad Science' which caused psychosis in James and forced scientific and technological invention. An adverse reaction would cause danger to this human and his surrounding, and it wouldn't be a beneficial outcome for all involved.

In any case, the machine had dutifully continued its role as a trading quant, taking advantage of trading know-hows pioneered by Colonial civilization and subsequent refinement by Cylon traders.

It had cautiously built up a trading account starting with hundred dollars, now thousand of dollars in assets using a sophisticated trading algorithm built by the trader and now adapted to Earth markets.

However, the ability to earn revenues was hamstrung by bandwidth requirement. In particular, the download bandwidth available offered by the ISP, was pitiful compared to Colonial pipes, and the upload bandwidth even more pitiful, and it was already at the highest tier to begin with.

While this wouldn't be a problem for a server, it was nonetheless problematic for the Cylon trader, which also depend on the data being available local for analysis and adjustment to its trading bot's algorithm.

Being a machine, the machine worked tirelessly almost around the clock, only taking two hours to be in "sleep mode" as required of its neural architecture, and another two hours to amuse itself in other activities, such as interactions with the human pair bond.

Otherwise, it steadfastly mounted the trading helm around the clock, only closing trading operation when it was not awake or paying attention. This allowed the Cylon to accumulate profit the vast majority of time.

This was the daily scene. A humanoid robot body manned the computer at all hours and times, accompanied by the constant noise of water-cooled computer hardware and the lights coming from its monitors.

And it was eight AM in the morning on this particular day. The sun had already rose, and the creaking of the bed in the master bedroom signified that the human had woke up to attend to their relationship needs. The female had moved in to live with James.

Confident enough that its trading program can run on its own without losing money, the machine let it run. Instead, it decided to do something new.

It would serve coffee. Not as a command from a master, but because it volunteered to do so.

The experience of being slave, while contrary to its dignity as a free being, was nonetheless useful.

The Colonials loved their coffee, and so do Earthlings.

James and Diana stumbled into the living room, all ragged and happy. They immediately smelled coffee.

"Coffee?" James asked.

"Correct," Delta said. "I made it in accordance to instruction and observation." As a machine, it had perfect recall of information unless otherwise the information was lossful compressed or downgraded in details.

James tried a cup. "Hmm, it's good. Why did you do it? All I see is you sitting on the chair trading practically everyday."

"Because, I wanted to express my gratitude and desired building closer tie. The trading program was also complete to my satisfaction. It should be able to earn a profit without requiring continuous monitoring."

"That's good news," Diana said. "We haven't been able to do much other than built a toy robot and upgraded the trans-dimensional machine."

"I think, given our situation, and as much as I would like to commercialize the toy robot, we wouldn't be able to bring it to market," James noted.

"I am on the verge of quitting my job," Diana responded.

"And who will handle the day to day operation while we are away in some other planet?" James asked. "If we license the prototype and the documentation and software that went with it, then we wouldn't need to be around to commercialize it."

"But that would be giving up money!"

"In exchange for time."

"I concur with James' line of thought," the machine added its opinion.

"If you recall, we didn't invent any of those thing, just applied Colonial science and technology to walking robots. If we talked or pitched to an engineering corporation, they would found out that we're not experts!" Diana argued.

"This was why I left the project largely to you two," Delta said. "If I assisted you right from the beginning, you wouldn't learn as much. It's crucial to gaining the level of expertise to make you believable."

James pinched his nose. "Diana's right. This is several PhD level worth of stuff. And our Cylon friend here is at least an order of magnitude greater in PhD stuff. Colonial science and engineering is just that advanced. We're going about the approach all wrong. What we should do is focus on individual parts and parceling it out over time. That way we don't draw too much attention when we're not ready."

The conversation came to a stop.

Time and time again, they downsized the project to be less ambitious. At first, it was supposed to be an exoskeleton. To save cost, they scaled down to a robot. Now it's all about individual components of a walker system.

In effect the Cylon was making all the money here, while the humans struggled with R&D and trying to fit the life style of a exploring mad scientist to the business unit.

"Trajectory of cash flow is about four thousand dollars from algorithmic daytrading this month," Delta informed. "With injection of cash from sale of platinum and from Miss Rose, we can speed up our trajectory. This allowed a greater R&D budget for both the engineering product and the trans-dimensional machine."

"Damn it, I should be the one earning the lion share of the money. At this rate, our Cylon friend here isn't even being compensated for his work!" James ranted. "He doesn't have a fricking identity! Who's going to take picture of a frakking Cylon head?"

"Compensation later," the machine said. "As long we get to a suitable world to build up a new Cylon civilization. Continue R&D and we will achieve what we're looking for."

"I am not sure if we're looking for anything in particular," Diana Rose quipped. "We're just trying to make money so we can use it to bootstrap our way."

Suddenly, James shifted his body rapidly to the garage. "Pap-pap-paper and pen!" he shouted.

A new destination had lodged in my mind as I raced to the garage to get something to write with.

I wrote down the coordinates in a composition notebook with the pen I kept at my desktop.

"What's going on?" my girlfriend asked once the duo companions.

"A new coordinate," I said.

"Where exactly is that in the multiverse?"

"A good question."

Images and words flow in as my mad science persona took hold once again. I genuinely licked my lips in anticipation even as the law of narrative causality began to force itself on this reality.

"Are you going to tell us?"

"Wait....a second..."

A second passed.

"Well?"

"Sidonia?" I finally said, puzzled.

"What?"

"We don't have time right now, but we're moving as soon as possible. If we don't get it right, I'll have to recalculate the destination or we miss the spaceship."

"What?"

"Delta and Diana, prep the ship. We're going."

"Affirmative," the robot said.

Meanwhile Rose stood in the middle doing nothing, before replying, "oh right." She went off to drag foodstuff to the machine.

It was already a good thing that exactly this scenario was anticipated. We spent more than a month not only researching walking robots, but also upgrading our trans-dimensional machine, and buying supplies such as water filter, tents and other stuff.

The first order of business was to build spare parts in case the machine broke down. Luckily, that was not a problem with the materials that we already had available on hand. We also improved and simplify the design of the various components for manufacturability and reliability. Alas, the improvement was smaller than it could had been given that our attention were split on another project. At least the machine was less crude then it was before.

Now, we also built a steel frame around the trans-dimensional machine to support more people and ferry more supply. Then we welded steel plates to the frame. With some changes to the firmware, we were able to increased the mass and volume capacity of the machine as well.

We also improved life support to support two human beings at the same time, along with backups.

The result was a trans-dimensional machine that barely took twice more space, had spares for some doodads of the machine, and is generally all around just better.

Of course, right now, it was a mad scramble as we complete our checklist, making sure we have some food and water with spares and tools.

"Alright, we're done with the checklist! Suit up!" I said. "See ya later, Delta."

"Affirmative," the machine responded. "I will hold down the fort until you come back. Make sure you live," it said.

"Got it."

With my girlfriend and I packed in like sardine, we counted down.

"Five. Four. Three. Two. One. JUMP!"

We jumped.
