**Sidonia**

Without taking any medicine, an immortal aged just like anybody else, unless the medicine was directly genetically engineered into a body, like in Nagate Tanikaze, who was out of reach from Sidonian authority.

Such was the case for Hiroki Saitou. The alleged hero of Sidonia, and a willing participant in the immortal conspiracy.

He walked to the witness stance with an elderly motion, a result of century of neglect.

Without a doubt, he is the immortal's strongest witness, but the ultimate outcome was already decided. No way forward will be done without an impeachment.

"Can you please state your name for the chamber?" the speaker said.

"My name is Saitou Hiroki, identification number 3212..," he rattled off, followed by a list of false identities that he also used in his service as a gardes pilot, and his kills, all verified cryptographically. He was amazingly heroic but he was also despotic, complicit in the conspiracy.

That was the crux of the issue, not the impeachment.

She tried to stop the trial in its track and begin a speedy conclusion, but the immortals won't have any of it. They really do wanted their day in court.

But now she was going to have to deal with the spectre of disunity, of immortals getting away. She could tolerate Shiro's spew about democracy all day, but she can't afford to widen support for the immortals.

It would...validate the immortals' rule, and change the character of Sidonia forever...

**Saitou Hiroki**

The pilot's tired eyes glazed over the audience, the very people that he dedicated his life to for hundred of years. They were angry, rightfully so, and they were putting everyone in his cross-hair.

Just how many people did he permit to fall to their death because the committee held back life saving medicine for the sake of stability? How many time did he permit Kobayashi to do as she pleased, as what she understood as 'necessary'?

However, in his heart, he felt he must defend his honor, and the honor of the remaining survivors. There's no way that they're going to look at only the crimes and not at any achievements. That way, only after a complete defense, that justice will be done.

He finally spoke. "Several hundred years ago...I took this oath, to help accomplish this mission by gifting my knowledge, my expertise, my very life. It may sound paradoxical to you, but I risked my life over centuries, defending this ark from the gauna. In my last battle, I saved Sidonia from destruction, but only just. That was my biggest regret and failure. "
