**Sidonia**

Without taking any medicine, an immortal aged just like anybody else, unless the body was genetically engineering was used to make someone immortal, like what happened to Nagate Tanikaze.

Hiroki Saitou was just another case of immortality induced medication. He was also the alleged hero of Sidonia, but also another willing participant in the immortal conspiracy.

This man walked to the witness stance with an elderly motion, a result of century of neglect.

Without a doubt, he is the immortal's strongest witness, but the ultimate outcome was already decided. No way forward will be done without an impeachment.

"Can you please state your name for the chamber?" the speaker said.

"My name is Saitou Hiroki, identification number 3212..," he rattled off, followed by a list of false identities that he also used in his service as a gardes pilot and officer, which are all verified cryptographically, and all are names of Sidonian war heroes.

To think this man was a war hero...She wanted to believe that it was all one huge lie, part of a fabricated history put out for public consumption. But once you doubt the history of your own people, there would be nothing else to doubt.

That was the crux of the issue, not the impeachment.

**Saitou Hiroki**

The pilot's tired eyes glazed over the audience, the very people that he dedicated his life to for centuries. They were angry, rightfully so, and they were putting every immortals in their cross-hair.

Just how many people did he permit to fall to their death because the committee held back life saving medicine for the sake of stability? How many time did he permit Kobayashi to do as she pleased, as what she understood as 'necessary'?

However, in his heart, there was a reason to live just as there was a reason for Kobayashi walked in to face the Diet weeks ago. He must defend his honor, and the honor of the remaining survivors so that they could have a life of some sort, not stuck rotting in a jail.

He finally spoke. "Several hundred years ago...I took this oath, to help accomplish this Ark's mission by gifting my knowledge, my expertise, and my very life. It may sound paradoxical to you, but I risked my life over the centuries, defending this ark from the gauna. In my last battle, I saved Sidonia from destruction, but only just. That was my biggest regret and failure..."

He launched into telling the war stories of every generation he served with, the names of the people he served with, friends that he had lost, all illustrated on a screen cross-linked across database and checked. Testimony was almost totally worthless without external evidence, even if they told the truth. Human memories were fallible that way.

Then, when he was finally done, he could see the tears that began flowing from the lawmakers.

He knew that he done his work, but was it enough?

The jail bars rolled away as Sasaki ran into Diana and I. She was freed, and there were no pending criminal charges against her.

We hugged for a good while as Sasaki sobbed quietly in my chest.

Sasaki was removed from office via impeachment, and she lost all her positions in Sidonian society. That was a small price to pay. Even her friend, Doctor Shinatose was right beside her hugging her own daughter.

I believed Kobayashi and Ochiai were not so lucky. They were facing potential criminal prosecutions, so they were not released. I didn't feel as bad as for them, but they were more distant to me, and their crime much more serious.

As heartless it may be, it wasn't my problem.

"Hey guys! Why don't you come over to my house for dinner?" Yure Shinatose asked.

I don't see why not.

**Nagai Juri**

Juri was seated in front of Kobayashi in the very room that the immortals was interrogated. It was the clean sleekness that cannot be commonly found elsewhere on the ship.

"I anticipated all your actions," Juri spoken first. "Yet, I never thought that Saitou Hiroki could be so loyal and so effective of a speaker. He managed to overturn public opinion to your side. Just over fifty percent."

"Is that bitterness in your tone?" Kobayashi asked.

"Bitter? Yes, I am. Opinions shouldn't turn based on a good sob story."

"This is why we insisted on having our day in court, in having our legacy examined fairly before the public. Saitou Hiroki was the very example of an outstanding immortal; he protected us so that our civilization can live another day."

"You know, I examined my genetic legacy the other day," Juri said with disgust. "Imagine to my horror that I was descended from you. You are, genetically, my grandmother, but you will never ever be a grandmother to me. I will prosecute you to the end of universe until we find justice! I will make sure that the history books will recognize you as the tyrant you are."

Kobayashi showed no reactions. "Is that all you have to say, granddaughter?"

"I am not your granddaughter."

"We are not that close that way, no, but I couldn't possibly care for every human in Sidonia in the same way that I cared for my son. Nonetheless, from now on, regardless of our relationship, you will always be my granddaughter. But if there's one thing you should take to heart in spite of your enmity of me, you shouldn't let the object of your hatred overpower you."

Juri stormed off at that very moment.

**Qrow Branwen**
**October 25, 2015**

The Sidonian crisis appeared to be over. Qrow still haven't drink any, despite refilling his flask with sake. Now wasn't the time. He could be drunk in front of Ozpin and Goodwitch, but not at such an important matter like these.

Aside from rumor of colonization and threat of a large proportion of the population to leave Sidonia, everything was back to normal, as much it could be.

He found himself confronting a couple of officers and an elevator, with their facemasks off. There were no longer any need for it, but traditions was hard to shake off.

"Can you please come with us," one of them said. "The captain is looking to meet you."

Qrow felt entirely naked. He wasn't allow to carry his weapon anywhere on the ship. Normally it wouldn't matter, since the Gauna was the threat and he would be useless in a mecha, but only in the last few days there were the very real possibility of civil war, though it seemed entirely remote these day.

Finally, the elevator opened up to the command center.

"Welcome, Qrow Branwen. You are the representative of Ozpin, correct?" Captain Seii said as he extended his hand out. He didn't even bother wearing a mask, unlike some of his immediate subordinates.

"That's one way to put it," Qrow said as he shook the captain's hand. "Though I am only a huntsman, it seemed that I also became a diplomat for this crisis. We are very concerned about the Kingdom of the Ark and what it means for Remnant."

"Hmm. That's certainly a poetic name for Sidonia, but I am afraid we wouldn't call ourselves a kingdom."

"It's a holdover from the old days. From what I understand, Earth history has monarchies too, and then they either were swept aways or become utterly powerless, just like how it happened on Remnant, though it never occurred to us that we would rename our kingdoms to republics."

"I am somewhat aware of your history, though I haven't time to contemplate your history to any details. Anyway, we are here to discuss the process of sending more military aids to Remnant, and I already informed all the diplomats about this matter. However, only you, have any relevant military expertise to understand what we are trying to do."

"Oh?" Qrow was already smiling. "Don't get me wrong, but I am not a military officer, just a simple huntsman."

"You'll have to do for now. The aid is pretty easy to understand. We'll sell weapon systems and how to make them, even sending technical advisors. In return however....we'll send soldiers, especially ground troops to defend the kingdoms and to support the huntsmen in the field. With the exception of immortals, we do not have any military experience whatsoever."

"I understand, though people might get nervous about foreign soldiers."

"We are only sending very few if any for the foreseeable future, to operate rescue services, for example. The kingdoms will all have choices in the number of soldiers they will allow on their soil. We will pay for whatever is necessary to keep them there, such as rent for any military bases we are willing to establish."

Qrow nodded. "I am sure that my political masters will savor at the economic opportunity. I am also seeing the potential for expansion of our borders."

"We like to believe that working together for mutual benefit is better than seeing Remnant as our rival."

On the television, Captain Seii talked about a referendum on which form of government do the citizen of Sidonia preferred.

Frankly, I don't see the point. The captain of the ship cannot avoid but deal with 'civilian matters', as Sidonia is effectively both a warship and a city. If the civilian leadership resisted so much on matters of maintenance, there's going to be a life and death problem, literally. The only other concern were societal functions that the military don't see fit to get too much involved in anyway.

So I flipped the television off.

"What's the matter?" Sasaki said, even as she focused on something tiny. With the loss of her jobs and banishment from important posts and positions, she was itching for something to do. So she focused solace in fixing up broken Remnan electronics.

"Nothing, it's just politics as usual."

"There's nothing about business as usual in this era."

"That's true, but I don't particularly care about who wins in this referendum. On another thought, what are you going to be doing from now on?"

"Hmm. It's hard to say. I thought about opening up an electronic repair shop, but that's just fixing up stuff. I want to work on true engineering projects. So I might look for a job in that. I heard that Remnant is hiring."

"I am sure that Sidonia will be crawling back to you."

Sasaki smiled. "Thanks for the vote of confidence. But it's time that I look for other opportunities. Hell, I might start a new company. That basically never happened in Sidonia. There wasn't any new niches to occupy for a long time."

Meanwhile, on the other hand, I was still employed by the laboratory. I did thought of leaving together with Sasaki, and convince my other girlfriend too, but in the end, Sasaki convinced me to stay on. There was no need to spite my face as a protest of Sasaki's removal, however much I dislike.

"Starting a new company, huh? What projects will you work on?"

"No idea, but I am not going to compete with Toha Heavy Industries for business."

"Right, they're already doing really important stuff. They make all the big stuff, don't they?"

"Yeah, that's the problem. If I compete with them, I'll feel like I am competing with my own family members. All my expertise is tied up with the company's specialities."

"They're a business, honey. No matter what happen, even if you fail, or succeed, you'll be hiring some of them. Sidonia is your family, not that one singular company."

"I guess you're right..." Sasaki straightened up her posture. "Then my next project will be a rocket engine I have in mind. There's a design I wanted to try out, which I thought was promising, but everybody else thought it was too hard."

"You're going to prove them wrong?"

"Life doesn't work that way, but part of the innovation process is going through blind alley and seeing unexpected connections. We might succeed, or we might not."

**Saitou Hiroki**
**Sidonia Military Academy**
**November 9, 2015**

It was bittersweet. Kobayashi was still locked away, but his grandson, Nagate Tanikaze came back. Then, Hiroki was offered a job by Captain Seii, which he easily accepted. He became a reserve pilot and a full time instructor at the military academy. Captain Seii said that in no certain term Sidonia couldn't afford to lose him.

Unfortunately he agreed, but his plan was to change all of that. There were always aces other than him in every generations, but Sidonia could, with enough time, make every single individual in the gardes corp an 'ace'.

His first task was to bring in the simulator that he and his grandson trained on. The academy students, with the exception of his grandson, won't be trained on this. They were goin to train with the new simulators. It was more for himself to instruct his students with in a shared VR experience.

A class of students entered, crowding the training room.

He can feel the respect extruding from the teenagers, for the legendary feats he attained in combat, even if they didn't respect the rest of what he did.

He smiled. "Welcome to the training simulator where you will constantly lose. I'll make it a hundred time harder then what it would be in real life. Don't worry, losing your friends or dying in combat will always be hundred time worse. Remember, a dead pilot is no good for Sidonia, and just one more individual dead until we are all dead. Are we clear?"

"YES SIR!" the class shouted.
