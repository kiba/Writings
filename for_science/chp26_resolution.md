**Sidonia**

Without taking any medicine, an immortal aged just like anybody else, unless the medicine was directly genetically engineered into a body, like in Nagate Tanikaze, who was out of reach from Sidonian authority.

Such was the case for Hiroki Saitou. The alleged hero of Sidonia, and a willing participant in the immortal conspiracy.

He walked to the witness stance with an elderly motion, a result of century of neglect.

Without a doubt, he is the immortal's strongest witness, but the ultimate outcome was already decided. No way forward will be done without an impeachment.

"Can you please state your name for the chamber?" the speaker said.

"My name is Saitou Hiroki, identification number 3212..," he rattled off, followed by a list of false identities that he also used in his service as a gardes pilot, which are a
all verified cryptographically, and all are names of Sidonian war heroes.

To think this man was a war hero...She wanted to believe that it was all one huge lie, part of a fabricated history put out for public consumption. But once you doubt the history of your own people, what is further to doubt?

That was the crux of the issue, not the impeachment.

**Saitou Hiroki**

The pilot's tired eyes glazed over the audience, the very people that he dedicated his life to for hundred of years. They were angry, rightfully so, and they were putting every immortals in their cross-hair.

Just how many people did he permit to fall to their death because the committee held back life saving medicine for the sake of stability? How many time did he permit Kobayashi to do as she pleased, as what she understood as 'necessary'?

However, in his heart, there was a reason to live just as there was a reason for Kobayashi walked in to face the Diet weeks ago. He must defend his honor, and the honor of the remaining survivors so that he could have a life of some sort, not stuck in a jail.

He finally spoke. "Several hundred years ago...I took this oath, to help accomplish this Ark's mission by gifting my knowledge, my expertise, my very life. It may sound paradoxical to you, but I risked my life over centuries, defending this ark from the gauna. In my last battle, I saved Sidonia from destruction, but only just. That was my biggest regret and failure..."

He launched into telling his war stories, the names of the people he served with, friends that he had lost, all illustrated on a screen cross-linked and checked. Testimony was worthless without external evidence.

Then, when he was finally done, he could see the tears that began flowing from the lawmakers.

He knew that he done his work, but was it enough?

The jail bars rolled away as Sasaki ran into Diana and I. She was freed, and there were no pending criminal charges against her.

We hugged for a good while as Sasaki sobbed in my chest.

Sasaki was removed from office via impeachment, and she lost all her positions in Sidonia, and even on Remnant. That was a small price to pay. Even her friend, Doctor Shinatose was right beside her hugging her daughter.

I believe Kobayashi and Ochiai were not so lucky. They were facing potential criminal prosecutions, so they were not released. I didn't feel as bad as for them, but they were more distant to me, and their crime much more serious.

As heartless it may sound, it wasn't my problem.

"Hey guys! Why don't you come over to my house for dinner?" Yure Shinatose asked.

I don't see why not.

**Nagai Juri**

Juri was seated in front of Kobayashi in a very white room, two of the immortals left who were imprisoned.

"You know, the other day, I had my genes checked. Guess what I found out?" Juri said. "You are my grandmother, to be exact. But I would never ever call you grandmother."

"That's unfortunate. I was hoping for reconciliation."

"You may be the foundation on which Sidonia is built on, but you are not the future."
