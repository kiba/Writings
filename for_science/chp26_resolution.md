# **Chapter Twenty-six: Resolution**

***
**Nagai Juri**
**Sidonia**

Without taking any medicine, an immortal aged just like anybody else, unless the medicine was directly genetically engineered into a body, like in Nagate Tanikaze, who was out of reach from Sidonian authority.

Such was the case for Hiroki Saitou. The alleged hero of Sidonia, and a willing participant in the immortal conspiracy.

He walked to the witness stance with an elderly motion, a result of century of neglect.

Without a doubt, he is the immortal's strongest witness, but the ultimate outcome was already decided. No way forward will be done without an impeachment.

"Can you please state your name for the chamber?" the speaker said.

"My name is Hiroki Saitou, identification number 3212..," he rattled off, followed by a list of false identities that he also used in his service as a gardes pilot, and his kills, all verified cryptographically. He was amazingly heroic but he was also despotic, complicit in the conspiracy.

That was the crux of the issue, not the impeachment.

She tried to stop the trial in its track and begin a speedy conclusion, but the immortals won't have any of it. They really do wanted their day in court.

But now she was going to have to deal with the spectar of disunity. She could tolerate Shiro's spew about democracy all day, but she can't afford to widen support for the immortals.

It would...validate the immortals' rule, and change the character of Sidonia forever...
