**Sidonia**

Without taking any medicine, an immortal aged just like anybody else, unless the medicine was directly genetically engineered into a body, like in Nagate Tanikaze, who was out of reach from Sidonian authority.

Such was the case for Hiroki Saitou. The alleged hero of Sidonia, and a willing participant in the immortal conspiracy.

He walked to the witness stance with an elderly motion, a result of century of neglect.

Without a doubt, he is the immortal's strongest witness, but the ultimate outcome was already decided. No way forward will be done without an impeachment.

"Can you please state your name for the chamber?" the speaker said.

"My name is Saitou Hiroki, identification number 3212..," he rattled off, followed by a list of false identities that he also used in his service as a gardes pilot, which are a
all verified cryptographically, and all are names of Sidonian war heroes.

To think this man was a war hero...She wanted to believe that it was all one huge lie, part of a fabricated history put out for public consumption. But once you doubt the history of your own people, what is further to doubt?

That was the crux of the issue, not the impeachment.

**Saitou Hiroki**

The pilot's tired eyes glazed over the audience, the very people that he dedicated his life to for hundred of years. They were angry, rightfully so, and they were putting every immortals in their cross-hair.

Just how many people did he permit to fall to their death because the committee held back life saving medicine for the sake of stability? How many time did he permit Kobayashi to do as she pleased, as what she understood as 'necessary'?

However, in his heart, there was a reason to live just as there was a reason for Kobayashi walked in to face the Diet weeks ago. He must defend his honor, and the honor of the remaining survivors so that he could have a life of some sort, not stuck in a jail.

He finally spoke. "Several hundred years ago...I took this oath, to help accomplish this Ark's mission by gifting my knowledge, my expertise, my very life. It may sound paradoxical to you, but I risked my life over centuries, defending this ark from the gauna. In my last battle, I saved Sidonia from destruction, but only just. That was my biggest regret and failure..."

He launched into telling his war stories, the names of the people he served with, friends that he had lost, all illustrated on a screen cross-linked and checked. Testimony was worthless without external evidence.

Then, when he was finally done, he could see the tears that began flowing from the lawmakers.

He knew that he done his work, but was it enough?

**Penitentiary Section 1091**
**October 24, 2015**

The jail bars rolled away as Sasaki ran into Diana and I. She was freed, and there were no pending criminal charges against her.

We hugged for a good while as Sasaki sobbed in my chest.

Sasaki was removed from office via impeachment, and she lost all her positions in Sidonia, and even on Remnant. That was a small price to pay. Even her friend, Doctor Shinatose was right beside her hugging her daughter.

I believe Kobayashi and Ochiai were not so lucky. They were facing potential criminal prosecutions, so they were not released. I didn't feel as bad as for them, but they were more distant to me, and their crime much more serious.

As heartless it may sound, it wasn't my problem.

"Hey guys! Why don't you come over to my house for dinner?" Yure Shinatose asked.

I don't see why not.

**Nagai Juri**

Juri was seated in front of Kobayashi in the very room that the immortals was interrogated. It was the same clean sleekness that cannot be commonly found elsewhere on the ship.

"I anticipated all your actions," Juri spoken first. "Yet, I never thought that Saitou Hiroki could be so loyal and so effective of a speaker. He managed to overturn public opinion to your side. Just over fifty percent."

"Is that bitterness in your tone?" Kobayashi asked.

"Bitter? Yes, I am. Opinions shouldn't turn based on a good sob story."

"This is why we insisted on having our day in court, in having our legacy examined fairly before the public. Saitou Hiroki was the very example of an outstanding immortal; he protected us so that our civilization can live another day."

"You know, I examined my genetic legacy the other day. Imagine to my horror that I was descended from you. You are my grandmother, genetically, but you will never ever be a grandmother to me. I will prosecute you to the end of universe until we find justice! I will make sure that the history books will recognize you as the tyrant that you were."

Juri finished the last sentence with a ragged breath.

Kobayashi showed no reactions. "Is that all you have to say, granddaughter?"

"I am not your granddaughter."

"We are not that close that way, no, but I couldn't possibly care for every human in Sidonia in the same way that I cared for my son. Nonetheless, from now on, regardless of our relationship, you will always be my granddaughter. But if there's one thing you should take to heart in spite of your enmity of me, you shouldn't let the object of your hatred overpower you."

Juri stormed off at that very moment.

**Qrow Branwen**
**October 25, 2015**

The Sidonian crisis appeared to be over. Qrow still haven't drink any, despite refilling his flask with sake.

Aside from rumor of colonization and invoking an ancient ship law so that a large proportion to leave Sidonia, everything was back to normal.

He found himself confronting a couple of officers and an elevator, with their facemasks off.

"Can you please come with us," one of them said. "The captain is looking to meet you."

Qrow felt entirely naked. He wasn't allow to carry his weapon anywhere on the ship. Normally it wouldn't matter, since the Gauna was the threat and he would be useless in a mecha, but there were the possibility of civil war, though it seemed entirely remote these day.

Finally, the elevator opened up to the command center.

"Welcome, Qrow Branwen. You are the representative of Ozpin, correct?" Captain Seii said as he extended his hand out.

"That's one way to put it," Qrow said as he shook the captain's hand. "Though I am only a huntsman, it seemed that I also became a diplomat for this crisis. We are very concerned about the Kingdom of the Ark and what it means for Remnant."

"Hmm. That's certainly a poetic name for Sidonia, but I am afraid we wouldn't call ourselves a kingdom."

"It's a holdover from the old days. From what I understand, Earth history has monarchies too, and then they either were swept aways or become utterly powerless, just like what it happened on Remnant, though it never occured to us that we would rename our kingdoms to republics."

"I am somewhat aware of your history, though it never occurred to me to think of that way. Anyway, we are here to discuss the process of sending more military aids to Remnant, and I already informed all the diplomats about this matter. However, only you, have any relevant military expertise to understand what we are trying to do."

"Oh?" Qrow was already smiling. "Don't get me wrong, but I am not a military officer, just a simple huntsman."

"You'll have to do. The aid is pretty easy to understand. We'll sell weapons and how to make them, even sending technical advisors. In return however....we'll send soldiers, especially ground troops to defend the kingdoms and to support the huntsmen in the field. With the exception of immortals, we do not have any military experience whatsoever."
