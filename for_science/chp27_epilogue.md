**Sidonia**

It had been what? Six months? Yet, Oobleck was already suiting up for a first contact mission to Earth.

"How do I look?" Oobleck asked his colleagues.

"Impeccable!" Professor Port approved.

"Don't ask me," Qrow said at the same time.

He was in his best suit, the kind that the Earthlings and Remnans would recognize as respectable.

"At least they relaxed the restriction on wearing a spacesuit," Oobleck said. The Remnant and Sidonian contact team be transiting from Remnant directly to Earth to the capital of the most powerful nation. From there, if all goes smoothly they would travel together to the United Nations headquarter.

If it all goes smoothly...

Of course, Oobleck and other huntsmen will be doubling as bodyguards, especially for their Sidonian counterparts, who all lacked aura.

Oobleck didn't think that the people of Earth will be out to kill the delegates, but you'll never know with the crazy humans on the other side.

"We got a ride to catch," Qrow said. "The faster we get this done, the faster I can get back to drinking."

"That's unbecoming of a gentleman!" Port protested. "A huntsman like you should not-"

Qrow put his hand up. "We all have our vice. Let go."

It was the perfect day to depart. The sky was clear blue, with singing birds, and a slight breeze. The TDMs were already prepared, ready to transport them to Earth.

There were also a large crowd of well-wishers, reporters, and of course protestors surrounding the TDMs.

Oobleck could see Cindy Blue from the distance reporting. People were lining up on a stand, getting ready for their turn to speak.

Many speeches were given, underlining the importance and the mission of this first contact delegation, and so on.

"Finally," Qrow said, as Ozpin said his last words. "This is the most dangerous part of the whole damn thing, but don't let your guard down on Earth. Just don't."

By the end of the speech, much of the expedition was ready, having spent time packing up before hand and doublechecking everything.

All that was left now was to embark.

Oobleck became the last one to board a TDM.

It was cold and freezing on Wednesday, January 13, 2016, when a pair of TDM appeared from thin air near the staircase of the Lincoln memorial.
