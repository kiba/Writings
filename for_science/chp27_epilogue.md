**Captain Kobayashi**

There was no question where Kobayashi was right now. She was in jail, wearing a prison uniform, doing useful busywork, listening to the television as it babbled on about the latest news about the outside world. The judge had deemed her guilty, and this was the result.

There's no doubt in her mind that the world, or the multiverse, will change rapidly for the next twenty years, and beyond that if new realities are continuing to be discovered.
Her regret that she won't be there to participate in it. It's all out of her hand. Part of her felt relieved. She won't have to make the hard decisions. Captain Seii will, if he managed to hold on to power.

Sadly, her friend Ochiai wasn't allowed to serve his sentence with her. The court deemed that Ochiai and herself were too dangerous to serve together. At least his sentence was much shorter than her, with only seven years.

But there will be no other prisoners with her. She will be completely alone in her experience.

Even her jail cell seemed barren of decoration. There were very few personal artifacts.

Sidonia reserved imprisonment only for the most serious of crimes. Murder certainly qualified for it, but there were only a few over the centuries. In fact, she was the only one housed at cellblock A in decades.

The guards who worked there weren't certainly career correctional officers, given that imprisonment was astonishingly rare. They were psychologists and therapists, the only companions in this prison, at least until...

The door slid open. "You got visitor!" Today was visitation day.

Kobayashi flipped off the television, put down her work, and walked outside.

"Grandma!" a boy exclaimed as he hug-tackled her. Her husband was nearby, looking on.

Visitation was only limited to once every week, and only four hours at a time, giving her only sixteen hours per month. Mail and letters was unlimited. She wanted more, but this was prison. For all the focus on rehabilitation and training, it was also punishment, however overshadowed that purpose may be.

***

There was a need for the adults to be alone, so the prison staffs volunteered to keep her grandson busy, while Kobayashi and Hiroki entered a special apartment. A practice that went thousand of years back on Earth, and verified experimentally to reduce suffering in prisoners and on society.

It was a small 'apartment', decorated like a domestic dwelling rather than a jail cell, filled with fridge stocked with food.

She made full use of it, cooking a simple dinner, and then bringing it to the table.

As she sat down opposite of Hiroki, she could see the healing on her husband's face. He looked middle age and the wrinkled lines had begun to disappears. It would take another five years or so before he deaged completely.

Kobayashi put her hand on Hiroki's face, feeling the contour of the wrinkled skin.

"You're getting better," she said.

"Of course dear, I have been taking my medicine," the ace pilot said. "My grandson and you provided me all the incentives I need to make sure that I am taking all the dosage. The doctor already said that she's feeling a whole lot better about me not suddenly dropping off dead."

"I know. She told me."

"Now dear, I got in contact with a lawyer. They're willing to take on your case."

She shook her head. "You don't need to do that for me."

"Maybe. But I need you to do it for our grandson. You need to be free. Sidonia needs you."

"Appealing to my patriotism, Saitou?"

"It's the truth."

"You know what I am going to say. I am going to serve my sentence, and I don't want any more shop talk or politics from you. I just want to enjoy our time together."

"As you wish, dear."

**James Archer**
**November 3, 2016**

Today's my time off, and for that luxury, I took a strode around Sidonia, surveying the changes being made.

About a quarter of the buildings have those scaffolds on the outside. Incessant jackhammering, pounding, and the hiss that came from welding torches also made it clear that there's a construction boom in progress, as a result of the economic boom in progress.

In addition, there's also a baby boom that's fueling the demand as well. Sidonians were feeling very optimistic about the future lately, although only about a year ago, they faced a constitutional crisis. It really spoke well of their emotional resilience. It also explained why there's a baby boom in progress as well.

I must say that there's actually not a whole of 'new housing'. Most were rehabilitated housing instead, reclaimed from before the apocalypse. Before the whole boom, many buildings were just not used. Maintenance were only done when it was clear that it would damage or destroy other parts of Sidonia.

The ark stopped looking so old and patchy. It's actually starting to look like a modern city now, although it thankfully still retained its lived-in architecture. At least it wasn't as ugly as Tokyo.

All of these were the results of gravity plates, a Colonial technology that made artificial gravity really cheap. It dramatically reduced energy cost, and in one fell stroke, made the gravity furnace completely obsolete, adding more space that can be used for something else as well. Thus, there were a whole lot of work being done at the bottom dismantling the gravity furnace and reusing the materials elsewhere.

There's an increasing shortage of labor to deal with the additional amount of work that needed to be done, which put additional demand on migration from Remnant.

I made my way to a busy town center. It was the same town that I first toured when I was a guest/prisoner. It look quite different now. Nowadays, there's more political slogans, more people discussing or making their protests. There's also more colors being injected into the scene. The Sidonians wore their uniforms, but there's also Remnans. Some of them visiting, but also some of them are full time residents.

Now that I thought about it, Sidonia never actually had to deal with immigration until now. People never moved between Sidonia and her sister ships back in the early days, because that was too impractical. With FTL equipped TDMs, that's totally doable. There were even talks of trying to find those arkships and reconnect, assuming if there are any left. However, even with FTL drive, finding those arks may be a futile exercise, like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

On my way to a cafe, I noticed a new building, a medical clinic, and a long line of people. The oldest and the frail were always bumped up ahead of the line, while the middle aged and younger folks followed behind.

They're all getting immortality pills. This was why some people are having children, because they feared losing out their chance. What they don't realize is that with access to the multiverse, energy and materials are essentially infinite. There's no need to worry about population bombs consuming all the resources.

Finally, I ended up at the cafe that my girlfriends wanted me to meet. Thankfully, I hadn't increased my harem beyond the two for the past years or so. I wanted to keep it that way.

Immediately, I spotted the redheads in the crowd of tables and headed there.

***

After the lunch at the cafe, we made our way to Sidonia's exploration command headquarter. There, the captain was waiting for us.

Even Sasaki was allowed in, especially after the captain pointed out in the last meeting that the immortals were experts at what they do and their loyalty wasn't even a question. Still, it didn't mean that Sasaki was going to be part of the government or given any position.

She was only a consultant, paid only a nominal sum for her service. At least that's how they spin it to everyone. It was just a way to keep and make use of her expertise for the nation.

"Good day to you, doctors," Captain Seii greeted us. He was supposed to be leading Sidonia's infantry branch, but fate had other plans in store for him. Thankfully, his original training made him well suited to command. "Thanks to you and everyone's hard work, we're able to explore the multiverse on our own, without relying on Archer's mysterious calculations." There were actually missions to adjacent universes without me coming up with a new address from out of nowhere.

Another thing that did happen is that it was no longer necessary to rely on me to provide coordinates. TDMs now transited near Sidonia and then dock, rather than just appearing in Sidonia. That was thanks to a series of beacon that had been slowly spread across various dimensions.

"So I heard you got something," Diana said.

"We did. We're recovering artifacts from a planet in the universe X21-NAJW. According to my scientists and engineers, the defining technology behind those artifacts is compression tech, 'bigger on the inside' they told me."

"Neat," I excitedly said. "I want to get my hand on it."

"You're the reverse-engineering expert. So you get to choose first."

That's just the way I like it. Exciting technology, no drama, and nobody's trying to imprison or kill me.

**Headmaster Ozpin**
**November 5, 2016**
**Remnant**

As headmaster Ozpin looked out to Vale from his office, he imagined the days when the sky weren't so filled with airships and spacecrafts. It was slow and imperceptible day to day, but sure enough Remnant was in the midst of its own space travel revolution. There was even an outpost on the broken moon.

The grimm, on the other hand, were unable to manifest itself outside Remnant's atmosphere, nor was it possible that they could be transported via any TDM. That was very good news.

It's comforting that there places where there are no Grimm, where people are free to grow and prosper. However, for those who stayed on this planet, it's another story entirely. The creature of darkness are still there, beckoning huntsmen to keep the safety. Until they are banished from the face of this planet, the huntsmen will be there to hold the line.

Of course, the Grimm wasn't his only worry. He viewed a report from the field on Torchwick and his accomplice.

Wanted posters are already out for a woman named Cinder Fall, and another for Emerald, a thief with a particularly troublesome semblance.

The door slid open, Goodwitch striding in with coffee.

"Still keeping up with the hunt?" Goodwitch asked.

"Qrow's doing fine, but unfortunately they hadn't yet found Torchwick just yet."

"That man...and his goons, they unknowingly cause a diplomatic incident, almost killed two innocents. They caused one of our student to cry."

"Unfortuantely, if that was the extent of Mr. Torchwick's crimes, I would be less worried. It seemed that he was part of a larger conspiracy that went beyond simply robbing dust stores. He have allied himself with the White Fang. I hate to say it, but without the diplomatic incident, we would had not directed resources to him."

"Amber," Goodwitch said cryptically.

Ozpin nodded. "Yes. Amber's assailants are somehow involved with Torchwick and the White Fang."

"Whatever they have planned, do you think it was disrupted by the Sidonians?"

"I hoped so. But I am afraid it only brought us some time. A plot may still be ticking."

**Delta Three Zero One**
**November 7, 2016**
**Sidonia**

From the beginning, there was a desire to be apart from the humans, to be free of the oppressors. Now, Delta Three Zero One wasn't so sure anymore. The humans here didn't think of the Cylons as mere toasters, unthinking automation. While there were prejudices, Delta recognized that this was the human condition. Without hard work, unjust discrimination inevitably results. The key was not to shun humanity but to work with them. For as long as there are individuals who are capable of judging a being on their character, it was worth doing.

Although, it wasn't always easy to do, given how precarious the situation seemed to be last year. Thankfully, the crisis never went violent. Although it made the Cylons felt very vulnerable, given their low population number and reliance on factories to replenish and grow their memberships.

What the Cylon did not doubt was James Archer, their greatest benefactor and steadfast collaborator.

"You want to go back?" Delta asked.

"Given how we benefited from their technology, how could I say no to Captain Seii?" Archer said. "At the very least, we could try to broker a peace treaty, or try to help during the reconstruction effort. And you guys get to go home?"

"Archer...it is those dimensions that the Cylons currently inhabit that are our homes. The Twelves Colonies of Kobol, though it is our origin, are not our home. We do not have any fond memories of the Colonies. If we go back there, it would defeat the purpose of our mission to ensure the continuity of the Cylon species."

"I, er, understand. I don't mean to imply that.."

"This unit understands and appreciate your concern. However, it believed that such a war would result in one victor over another. As such there is a very low probability of peaceful co-existence of Colonial humans and the Cylons who remained there."

"If we could stop a war..."

"This unit advises that you tread carefully on the decision to re-enter Colonial space. There is no telling how much resources, times, or lives will be spent on the endeavor to reconnect with Colonial civilization. Much of any unique Colonial technologies has already been absorbed by Sidonia and Remnant."

"I understand, but we're talking about twelves planets and billion of human beings, and more Cylons. That's some serious economic might that could be used to improve the lives of everyone."

"Sidonia is very small population-wise compared to Remnant, let alone Earth proper. Inviting a new power will change the balance of power."

"The power of balance is going to change once Earth comes online," Archer acknowledged.

"There's no guarantee of peaceful relation and close cooperation with Colonial civilization," Delta pointed out. "This unit hoped that you will not initiate first contact so soon after Earth."

Archer nodded. "Yeah. You're right. I am getting a little bit ahead of myself.."

**President-elect of the United States**
**January 13, 2017
**Earth**

"What's going on?" the President-elect said as the protection details rushed her away from her room, to outside, and then into a car, all in one smooth motion.

"Just a precaution, Mrs. President," the man in black right next to her informed, before he handed her an ipad with the relevant website loaded.

"What this? Men and machine appearing out of thin air on the National Mall? Is this a joke?"

"We don't know what's going on ourselves, but my boss said we need to get you out of there. I don't believe it myself, but I did confirm that my boss is not joking."

The president-elect mind traversed through all the secret briefing that she had gotten from the presidency. There was really nothing that came to mind that could be this bizarre.

Even the photo didn't look that serious. It looked like a whole bunch of people decided to play dress up. Though there was an apparent robot walking around that couldn't possibly be someone in a suit.

Yes, this must be a hoax. The secret service was overreacting. Once they realized it's all a hoax, she will be back at the hotel room.

But she never went back there.
