**Captain Kobayashi**

There was no question where Kobayashi was right now. She was in jail, wearing a prison uniform, doing useful busywork, listening to the television as it babbled on about the latest news about the outside world. That was the outcome of the criminal trial she endured.

Things were going to change rapidly for the next twenty years, and she won't be there to participate in it. It's all out of her hand. Part of her felt relieved. She won't have to make the hard decisions. Captain Seii will, if he managed to hold on to power.

Sadly, her friend Ochiai wasn't allowed to serve his sentence with her. The court deemed that her and Ochiai were too dangerous to serve together. At least his sentence was much shorter than her, with only seven years.

But she was alone.

Even her jail cell seemed barren of decoration. There were very few personal artifacts.

Sidonia reserved imprisonment only for the most serious of crimes. Murder certainly qualified for it, but there were only a few over the centuries. In fact, she was the only one housed at cellblock A in decades.

The guards who worked there weren't certainly career correctional officers. They were psychologists and therapists, the only companions in this prison, at least until...

The door slid open. "You got visitor!" Today was visitation day.

Kobayashi flipped off the television, put down her work, and walked outside.

"Grandma!" a boy exclaimed as he hug-tackled her. Her husband was nearby, looking on.

Visitation was only limited to once every week, and only four hours at a time, giving her only sixteen hours per month. Mail and letters was unlimited. She wanted more, but this was prison. For all the focus on rehabilitation and training, it was also punishment, however overshadowed that purpose may be.

***

There was a need for the adults to be alone, so the prison staffs volunteered to keep her grandson busy, while Kobayashi and Hiroki entered a special apartment.

It was a small 'apartment', decorated like a domestic dwelling rather than a jail cell, filled with fridge stocked with food.

She made full use of it, cooking a simple dinner, and then bringing it to the table.

As she sat down opposite of Hiroki, she could see the healing on her husband's face. He looked middle age and the wrinkled lines had begun to disappears. It would take another five years or so before he deaged completely.

Kobayashi put her hand on Hiroki's face, feeling the contour of the wrinkled skin.

"You're getting better," she said.

"Of course dear, I have been taking my medicine," the ace pilot said. "A purpose in life with my grandson motivated me to not miss a dose. The doctor already said that she's feeling a whole lot better about me not suddenly dropping off dead."

"I know. She told me."

"Now dear, I got in contact with a lawyer. They're willing to take on your case."

She shook her head. "You don't need to do that for me."

"Maybe. But I need to do it for our grandson. You need to be free. Sidonia needs you."

"Appealing to my patriotism, Saitou?"

"It's the truth."

"You know what I am going to say. I don't want any more shop talk or politics from you. I just want to enjoy our time together."

"As you wish, dear."

**James Archer**
**November 3, 2016**

Today's my time off, and for that luxury, I took a strode around Sidonia, surveying the changes being made.

About a quarter of the buildings have those scaffolds on the outside. Incessant jackhammering, pounding, and the hiss that came from welding torches also made it clear that there's a construction boom in progress, as a result of the economic boom in progress.

In addition, there's also a baby boom that's fueling the demand as well. Sidonians were feeling very optimistic about the future lately, although only about a year ago, they faced a constitutional crisis.

I must say that there's actually not a whole of 'new housing'. Most were rehabilitated housing instead, reclaimed from before the apocalypse. The baby boom was also fueling the demand for those housing.

The ark stopped looking so old and patchy. It's actually starting to look like a modern city now, although it thankfully still retained its quaint architecture.

All of these were the results of gravity plate, a Colonial technology. It dramatically reduced energy cost, and in one fell stroke, made the gravity furnace completely obsolete. Thus, there were a whole lot of work being done at the bottom dismantling the gravity furnace and reusing the materials elsewhere.

There's an increasing shortage of labor to deal with the additional amount of work that needed to be done, which put additional demand on migration from Remnant.

I made my way to a busy town center. It was the same town that I first toured when I was a guest/prisoner. It look quite different now. Nowsday, there's more political slogans, more people discussing or making their protests. There's also more colors being injected into the scene. The Sidonians wore their uniforms, but there's also Remnans. Some of them visiting, but also some of them are full time residents.

Now that I thought about it, Sidonia never actually had to deal with immigration until now. People never moved between Sidonia and her sister ships back in the early days, because that was too impractical. With FTL equipped TDMs, that's totally doable. There were even talks of trying to find those arkships and reconnect, assuming if there are any left.

On my way to a cafe, I noticed a new building, a medical clinic, and a long line of people. The oldest and the frail were always bumped up ahead of the line, while the middle aged and younger folks followed behind.

They're all getting immortality pills. This was why some people are having children, because they feared losing out the chance. What they don't realize is that with access to the multiverse, energy and materials are essentially infinite. There's no need to worry about population bombs consuming all the resources.

Finally, I ended up at the cafe that my girlfriends wanted me to meet. Thankfully, I hadn't increased my harem beyond the two for the past years or so. I wanted to keep it that way.

Immediately, I spotted the redheads in the crowd of tables and headed there.

***

After the lunch at the cafe, we made our way to Sidonia's exploration command headquarter. There, the captain was waiting for us.

Even Sasaki was allowed in, especially after the captain pointed out in the last meeting that the immortals were experts at what they do and their loyalty wasn't even a question. Still, it didn't mean that Sasaki was going to be part of the government or given any position.

She was only a consultant, paid only a nominal sum for her service. At least that's how they spin it to everyone. It was just a way to keep and make use of her expertise for the nation.

"Good day to you, doctors," Captain Seii greeted us. He was supposed to be the general of Sidnoia's infantry branch, but fate had other plans in store for him. "Thanks to you and everyone's hard work, we're able to explore the multiverse on our own, without relying on Archer's mysterious calculations." There were actually missions to adjacent universes without me coming up with a new address from out of nowhere.

Another thing that did happen is that it was no longer necessary to rely on me to provide coordinates. TDMs now transited near Sidonia and then dock, rather than just appearing in Sidonia. That was thanks to a series of beacon that had been slowly spread across various dimensions.

"So I heard you got something," Diana said.

"We did. We're recovering artifacts from a planet in the universe X21-NAJW. According to my scientists and engineers, the defining technology behind those artifacts is compression tech, 'bigger on the inside' they told me."

"Neat," I excitedly said. "I want to get my hand on it."

"You're the reverse-engineering expert. So you get to choose first."

That's just the way I like it. Exciting technology, no drama, and nobody's trying to imprison or kill me.

**Headmaster Ozpin**
**November 5, 2016**
**Remnant**

It wasn't all that long ago that the sky wasn't so filled. Headmaster Ozpin could see it in his office with his own eyes, looking out to Vale. Skyships and spacecrafts now piled the sky above Vale. There was even an outpost on the broken moon.

The grimm, on the other hand, were unable to manifest itself outside Remnant's atmosphere, nor was it possible that they could be transported via any TDM. That was very good news.

It's comforting that there places where there are no Grimm, where people are free to grow and prosper. However, for those who stayed on this planet, it's another story entirely. The creature of darkness are still there, beckoning huntsmen to keep the safety. Until they are banished from the face of this planet, the huntsmen will be there.

Of course, the Grimm wasn't his only worry. He viewed a report from the field on Torchwick and his accomplice.

Wanted posters are already out for a woman named Cinder, and another for Emerald, a thief with the semblance of tricking minds.

The door slid open, Goodwitch striding in with coffee.

"Still keeping up with the hunt?" Goodwitch asked.

"Qrow's doing fine, but unfortunately they hadn't yet found Torchwick just yet."

"That man...and his goons, they unknowingly cause a diplomatic incident, almost killed two innocents. They caused one of our student to cry."


"Unfortuantely, if that was the extent of Mr. Torchwick's crimes, I would be less worried. Unfortunately, it seemed that he was part of a larger conspiracy that went beyond simply robbing dust stores. He seemed to have allied himself with the White Fang. I hate to say it, but without the diplomatic incident, we would had not directed resources to him."

"Amber," Goodwitch said cryptically.

Ozpin nodded. "Yes. Amber's assailants are somehow involved with Torchwick and the White Fang."

"Whatever they have planned, do you think it was disrupted by the Sidonians?"

"I hoped so. But I am afraid it only brought us some time. A plot may still be ticking."

**Delta Three Zero One**
**November 7, 2016**
**Sidonia**

From the beginning, there was a desire to be apart from the humans, to be free of the oppressors. Now, Delta Three Zero One wasn't so sure anymore. The humans here didn't think of the Cylons as mere toasters, unthinking automation. While there were prejudices, Delta recognized that there were other prejudices against each other.

Which was good, given how precarious the situation was last year. The humans on the arkship failed to initiate a violent civil war amongst themselves. The Cylons' low population numbers and reliance on factories for production of new units had to be kept in mind at all time.

But what was not in doubt was James Archer, their greatest benefactor.

"You want to go back?" Delta asked.

"Yes. I talked to Captain Seii about it," Archer said. "He thought it would be great to meet those Colonials, and your cousins from back home. He's receptive to brokering any peace deal, if it's at all possible. Then you guys would be able to go back home."

"Archer, this ark is our home. Remnant is our home. The 12 colonies are not our home. If we go back, it would defeat the purpose of our mission. Its perimeter may have changed, but the goal wasn't. we wanted to live in a safe and supportive society, and we want to ensure continuity by spreading ourselves."

"I, er, understand. I don't mean to imply that.."

"This unit understands, though this unit thought the probability of peace with Colonial humans low, and that the war may be in progress or had already reached its outcome. In any case, the result would be brutal."

"If we could stop a war..."

"There is a concern of our moral standing diminishing because of our association with a warring group."

"You mean, your concern for war crimes committed by the Cylons."

"Correct. Currently, there is not yet a crime committed by any Cylons, in part due to low population number, but also due to Cylon mental stability. As such, our moral standing is also highly inflated, which may cause a greater than usual negative backlash amongst humans. As such, we wish to plan and arrange public debates as to lower expectation. "

"I completely understand. I really do."

"This unit is glad that you do."

Archer stood up. "I'll run this by Seii. We're going to do this. Come back to the Colonies, after first contact is all finished up. Speaking of first contact, you're going to be part of the delegates to Earth?"

"Affirmative. Delta Three-Zero-One will be the official Cylon ambassador to Earth."

Archer nodded. "Yeah. You're going to be a real big surprise to Earth."

**President-elect of the United States**
**January 13, 2017
**Earth**

"What's going on?" the President-elect said as the secret service officers acted up, moving her from her hotel room to outside and into a car, all seemingly in one motion.

"Just a precaution ma'am," a man in black informed.

She was handed an ipad with the relevant information.

"What this? Men and machine appearing out of thin air on the National Mall? Is this a joke?"

"What's ever going on here, we don't know, but we know we are to take you away from the capitol as far as possible."

The president-elect mind traversed through all the secret briefing that she had gotten from the presidency. There was really nothing that came to mind that could be this bizarre.

Even the photo didn't look that serious. It looked like someone decided to play dress up. Though there was an apparent robot walking around that couldn't possibly be someone in a suit.

Yes, this must be a hoax. The secret service was overreacting.

To her dismay and surprise, it wasn't a hoax at all.
