**Captain Kobayashi**

There were no question where Kobayashi was right now. She was in jail, wearing a prison uniform, doing useful busywork, listening to the television as it babbled on about the latest news about the outside world.

It was going to be a long twenty years and she's going to miss so much of history.

Not even her friend Ochiai was allowed to serve his sentence with her. His sentence was much shorter. Only a mere seven years.

She was alone.

Even her jail cell seemed barren of decoration. There were very few personal artifacts.

Sidonia generally don't do imprisonment except for the most serious crime. Very few murder. In fact, she was the only one in cellblock A.

The guards who worked here played with her, keep company, and most importantly keep her sane.

The door slid open. "You got visitor!"

Kobayashi flipped off the television, put down her work, and walked outside.

"Grandma!" a boy exclaimed as he hug-tackled her. Her husband was nearby, looking on.

Visitation was only limited to once every week, and only four hours at a time, giving her only sixteen hours per month. Mail and letters was unlimited. She wanted more, but this was prison. For all the focus on rehabilitation and training, it was also punishment.

***

Her grandson was outside playing with some of the prison staff somewhere, while Kobayashi and Hiroki ended up in a place designated for conjugal visit.

It was a small 'apartment', decorated like a domestic dwelling rather than a jail cell. It even have a fridge and kitchen stocked with all the necessary items to cook food.

She could see the healing on her husband's face. He no longer looked like a ragged old man, but he was still elderly looking.

Kobayashi put her hand on Hiroki's face, feeling the contour of the wrinkled skin.

"You're getting better," she said.

"I haven't found the need to cease taking medication," the ace pilot said. "A purpose in life with my grandson starve off that feeling. The doctors said they feel more comfortable with me. I am not going to drop dead."

"Of course. I received letters from your doctor."

"Now dear, I got in contact with a lawyer. They're willing to take on your case."

She shook her head. "You don't need to do that for me."

"Maybe. But I need to do it for our grandson. You need to be here. Sidonia needs you."

"Appealing to my patriotism, Saitou?"

"It's the truth."

"I don't want any more shop talk or politics from you. I just want to enjoy our time together."

"As you wish, dear."

Today's my time off, and for that, I took really long walk around Sidonia, surveying the changes that was being made.

There's lot of construction going on, a tell-tale sign of a new economic boom in progress. Facilities were being remodeled as fast as Sidonia could manufacture gravity plates, which was acquired by me from the Colonials during my travel.

In addition, there's also a baby boom that's fueling the demand as well. Sidonians were feeling very optimistic about the future lately, although only about a year ago, they faced a constitutional crisis.

I must say that there's not a whole of new housing. Most were rehabilitated housing instead.
Of course, there's also a baby boom, increasing demand for new housing. Actually, there were lot of room that simply went unused because the population wasn't large enough even after hundred of years of growth.

The ark stopped looking so old and patchy. It's actually starting to look like a modern city now, although thankfully still lived in.

Gravity plates also endenger another effect: increased available energy and more room at the room. The old gravity furnace was being dismantled piece by piece, lowering the cost of 'land' for everyone.

With all the work that needed to be done, there's a shortage of labor and increasing wages, which put strong demand on migration.

I made my way to a busy town center. It was the same town that I first toured when I was a guest/prisoner. It look quite different now. Nowsday, there's more political slogans, more people discussing or making their protests. There's also more colors being injected into the scene. The Sidonians wore their uniforms, but there's also Remnans. Some of them visiting, but also some of them are full time residents.

For the first time in thousand of years, Sidonia was handling actual migrants.

On my way to a cafe, I noticed a new building, a medical clinic, and a long line of people. The oldest and the frail were always bumped up ahead of the line, while the middle aged and younger folks followed behind.

They're all getting immortality pills. This was why some people are having children, because they feared losing out the chance. However, with an unlimited access to the multiverse, it's a silly concern, because the scarcity of resources was a non-problem.

Finally, I ended up at the cafe that my girlfriends wanted me to meet. Thankfully, I hadn't increased my harem beyond the two.

Immediately, I spotted the redheads in the crowd of table and headed there.
