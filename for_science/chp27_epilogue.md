**Captain Kobayashi**

There were no question where Kobayashi was right now. She was in jail, wearing a prison uniform, doing useful busywork, listening to the television as it babbled on about the latest news about the outside world.

It was going to be a long twenty years and she's going to miss so much of history.

Not even her friend Ochiai was allowed to serve his sentence with her. His sentence was much shorter. Only a mere seven years.

She was alone.

Even her jail cell seemed barren of decoration. There were very few personal artifacts.

Sidonia generally don't do imprisonment except for the most serious crime. Very few murder. In fact, she was the only one in cellblock A.

The guards who worked here played with her, keep company, and most importantly keep her sane.

The door slid open. "You got visitor!"

Kobayashi flipped off the television, put down her work, and walked outside.

"Grandma!" a boy exclaimed as he hug-tackled her. Her husband was nearby, looking on.
