It had been what? Six months? Yet, Oobleck was already suiting up for a first contact mission to Earth.

"How do I look?" Oobleck asked his colleagues.

"Impeccable!" Professor Port approved.

"Don't ask me," Qrow said at the same time.

He was in his best suit, the kind that the Earthlings and Remnans would recognize as respectable.

"At least they relaxed the restriction on wearing a spacesuit," Oobleck said. The Remnant and Sidonian contact team be transiting from Remnant directly to Earth to the capital of the most powerful nation. From there, if all goes smoothly they would travel together to the United Nations headquarter.

If it all goes smoothly...

Of course, Oobleck and other huntsmen will be doubling as bodyguards, especially for their Sidonian counterparts, who all lacked aura.

Oobleck didn't think that the people of Earth will be out to kill the delegates, but you'll never know with the crazy humans on the other side.

"Let's not be late," Qrow Branwen. "The longer we get this over with, the faster I can get to my drinking."

"I just hope that you won't drink on the job," Oobleck responded.

"I agree! That's just unbecoming of a gentleman!" Port concurred.

"Whatever," Qrow said.

It was a beautiful morning, with clear blue sky, singing birds, and a slight breeze. Fourth generation TDM was already parked, ready to transport them to Earth, this time they won't need Archer's help in calculating the coordinates.

Meanwhile, the media and well-wishers surrounded the expedition, cheering on the delegates.
