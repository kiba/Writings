It had been what? Six months? Yet, Oobleck was already suiting up for a first contact mission to Earth.

"How do I look?" Oobleck asked his colleagues.

"Impeccable!" Professor Port approved.

"Don't ask me," Qrow said at the same time.

He was in his best suit, the kind that the Earthlings and Remnans would recognize as respectable.

"At least they relaxed the restriction on wearing a spacesuit," Oobleck said. The Remnant and Sidonian contact team be transiting from Remnant directly to Earth to the capital of the most powerful nation. From there, if all goes smoothly they would travel together to the United Nations headquarter.

If it all goes smoothly...

Of course, Oobleck and other huntsmen will be doubling as bodyguards, especially for the more vulnerable Terran heritage humans.
