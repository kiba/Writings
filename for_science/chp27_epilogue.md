**Captain Kobayashi**

There were no question where Kobayashi was right now. She was in jail, wearing a prison uniform, doing useful busywork, listening to the television as it babbled on about the latest news about the outside world.

It was going to be a long twenty years and she's going to miss so much of history.

Not even her friend Ochiai was allowed to serve his sentence with her. His sentence was much shorter. Only a mere seven years.

She was alone.

Even her jail cell seemed barren of decoration. There were very few personal artifacts.

Sidonia generally don't do imprisonment except for the most serious crime. Very few murder. In fact, she was the only one in cellblock A.

The guards who worked here played with her, keep company, and most importantly keep her sane.

The door slid open. "You got visitor!"

Kobayashi flipped off the television, put down her work, and walked outside.

"Grandma!" a boy exclaimed as he hug-tackled her. Her husband was nearby, looking on.

Visitation was only limited to once every week, and only four hours at a time, giving her only sixteen hours per month. Mail and letters was unlimited. She wanted more, but this was prison. For all the focus on rehabilitation and training, it was also punishment.

Her grandson was off playing with some of the prison staff somewhere, while Kobayashi and Hiroki ended up in a room specified for conjugal visit.

It was a small 'apartment', decorated like a domestic dwelling rather than a jail cell. It even have a fridge and kitchen stocked with all the necessary items to cook food.

She could see the healing on her husband's face. He no longer looked like a ragged old man, but he was still elderly looking.

Kobayashi put her hand on Hiroki's face, feeling the contour of the wrinkled skin.

"You're getting better," she said.

"I haven't found the need to cease taking medication," the ace pilot said. "A purpose in life with my grandson starve off that feeling. The doctors said they feel more comfortable with me. I am not going to drop dead."

"Of course. I received letters from your doctor."

"Now dear, I got in contact with a lawyer. They're willing to take on your case."

She shook her head. "You don't need to do that for me."

"Maybe. But I need to do it for our grandson. You need to be here. Sidonia needs you."

"Appealing to my patriotism, Saitou?"

"It's the truth."

"I don't want any more shop talk or politics from you. I just want to enjoy our time together."

"As you wish, dear."
