In the airless vacuum of space, an audience of about three was present on a test site in an inflatable module, next to a test site. An archaic gun was custom built to order for this occasion. Its target was a piece of modern armor downrange.

"We are now on Test Zero Twenty One, M829 APFSDS tank round for the 120mm M256 smoothbore tank gun designed in the latest twenty century about a thousand years ago, give or take," Sasaki announced to her audience. "Three two one, fire in the hole!"

The gun fired off a round on the outer surface of Sidonia, striking a piece of armor that Sasaki wanted so badly as armor on the trans-dimensional machine.

The round strike the target with pinpoint accuracy, shredding itself into a cloud of dust. There was nothing on the armor itself; a testament to thousand years of armor evolution.

"Now can you see why?" Sasaki said to Diana's boyfriend. Said boyfriend went slackjawed for a moment before composing himself.

"A gun from an Abram tank?" Archer asked.

"A replica faithfully reproduced according to design, and it's on the lower end of the spectrum of what Sidonia is truly capable of. We have a lot of knowledge from deep time." Nothing on early twenty-first century Earth could possibly match the Sidonian in military technology and engineering.

"I...want it."

"Of course you do, and you're going to let me rebuild the damn thing."

"James, please. If they're going to sabotage your ship, why wait?" Diana Rose offered her council.

"Damn right. I am going to be the one sitting in your machine, transiting to who know where. I preferred that the machine is up to Sidonian military engineering standard," Sasaki concurred.

Finally, the male sighed in defeat. "Fine. But you're going to teach the both of us how it work."

Sasaki smiled. "Of course. And you mister, are going to teach me everything about trans-dimensional theory and explain in detail about how to engineer such a device."

**Captain Kobayashi**
**April 8, 2015**

Kobayashi was without her mask, as that was standard when talking to a fellow immortal. They're all in on the secret anyway. Together, Kobayashi was standing in a discreet hallway with Sasaki, one of the other immortal who had survived the near total destruction of Sidonia a hundred years ago.

"Sasaki," she said. "The security team may have missed a spot with their interrogation video."

"You're asking me to spy?"

"I don't want you implanting bugs and jeopardizing their trust."

"I can't do it, but security can?"

"I am not training you in spycraft, but it would be prudent to have someone that they can trust unconditionally. I just want the story on this particular footage."

Sasaki watched the annotated video, before finally commenting. "Their story wasn't altogether air-tight."

"This is one of the secrets that they kept a tight lip, but we weren't able to ferret out given our inexperience in spycraft."

"But if you're asking me to spy on them but build trust from them...isn't that opposite. It would be better if somebody else do it. However, I  think I can report on the questions that they ask of me. It's their secret to tell." The interrogation videos weren't a secret to the interviewee, just that the annotations and translations were left out of the video.

"You're right. That's all I ask. But don't promise what you can't keep. This is probably the last video that I will show to you."

"I'll make sure of that, Captain."

[i]Dear journal,

As a result of Captain Kobayashi, I was determined to be on bad term with Sidonia, to make it clear that I don't like coercion, but that determination didn't last. The people of Sidonia behaved the same as before and Sasaki in particular proved to be particularly good in wearing me down, which led to a demonstration of the armor that they use.

Which then finally led to the mending of my relationship with my significant other.

That woman, along with my girlfriend of course forced me to see reason. It would not be in her interest in laying down traps in the very same vehicle that she will occupy when we travel back to Earth.

On the other hand, I couldn't rule out bugs that Sidonia might have left inside the transit machine itself.

I am looking forward to whatever design that they cooked up. It would be quick and dirty by their standard, but it should be a lot better than the previous iteration. Though, I will miss Rose. That shouldn't be much of a problem since it's a short stomach churning hop away.[/i]

It took a little over a week, but they finally done it! Or Sasaki and her team did. I, along with Diana mostly bother them and ask questions. It's a little bit of not trusting them and wanting to be knowledgable about the craft that I am using it to transit between worlds.

"It didn't look like something out of Mad Max," Diana commented.

"I like that look, but I admit that I do like what it looked like now."

It looked like what NASA might have made, with its pure industrial look and no frills, different from the sheet metals Diana and I cobbled up when the last time we did an upgrade.

"Let's check the inside."

I nodded.

The trans-dimensional machine grew larger slightly, and it was less cramped than before, but not by much. The main limitation being the bubble size surrounding the space-time generator.

The inside looked like the internals of the international space station, jam packed with god knows what. It was both messy and organized. I tried to keep up with the details but I couldn't keep up with what Sasaki wanted to install and build.

"Cramped as usual," she said.

"I doubt that's going to change if we make the vehicle bigger than it is now."

Ideas cycled through my mind as I thought about the idea of building smaller vehicles and devices to complement the trans-dimensional machine, because as of now, it's going to stand out a lot. Smaller vehicles would be harder to spot.

"Is it the same machine?"

I shrugged. "Maybe. Pretty much everything is replaced but the actual electronics for transiting between worlds." I was still nailing down the schematics and designs for the transit device, along with rationalizing it.

"So it's an entirely new machine then."

"Maybe."

This was supposed to be a quick stop-gap to make the machine safer for their occupants. I am pretty sure that that they're going to design something proper for themselves.

"These are old extra-vehicular suits," Sasaki said, explaining to her ancestors from a parallel dimension. "They are family heirlooms, passed from one generation to the next. I expect you two to take good care of it."

The trio were in Sasaki's home, and for a senior engineer, it was surprising modest. Thousand of years had passed and the interior were designed in accordance with traditional Japanese house plans.

"So...I am going to bring that suit?" the electrical engineer asked.

"Yep, every crewmember is required to know how to wear and operate one. I won't let you go home without the suit."

"It's clean, right?" Diana inquired.

"Of course, it's clean," Sasaki assured. I put them through the washing machine before you two came.

"Astronaut suits take forever to wear," James stated. "Not to mention that it's hard to move your hands."

"Oh, we have thousand of years to develop extra-vehicular suit. It's much more comfortable and easier to wear. However, the one single exception is the urinary catheter."

"Which is?"

"All you need to know is that it's going to hurt." Which is to say that the urinary catheter was how astronauts go to the restroom in space, but the insertion will be a painful affair for their users.

Archer did an involuntary wince.

The excursion into zero-g was the most fun she ever had. Experiencing microgravity was quite a novel experience, though most of the time was focused on Sasaki's rapid instructions, noting that this sort of stuff was taught to Sidonian children and wasn't touched on after that. However, the couple wasn't going to have enough time to learn all of this before James was scheduled to depart for Earth, just enough to know how to make real use of the suits that are now their own.

Now, she was back on solid ground, just walking and holding hand with her boyfriend.

"You know, if this is a story, then it's a pretty uneventful so far," her boyfriend said, trying to make small talk.

"That's not true," she said, recalling the tranquilizer knockout delivered by Sidonian security and the subsequent interrogation. It wasn't entirely pleasant. "There's a blowup after I found out what you were doing, and there's a blowup after the negotiation went horribly."

James exhaled. "I wish they asked nicely."

"They did."

"After the captain made it clear to us that they won't let us go if we don't give them the technology and dimensional travel. Now I am forced to leave you behind."

"I am going to be fine. It's only going to be a few days."

"I know you are. But I can't help but worry."

Diana slumped against her boyfriend's shoulder. "I am going to be fine. Sasaki's the best engineer we got, and she's going with you."

"I hope that nothing bad was going to happen when I get back home, like a SWAT raid. I am worried for Delta."

Nothing bad happened when they did sold their platinum, but it was always back in their mind, since there was no way to reasonable explain where James go the platinum from.

"You're going to be just fine. Everything's going to be alright."

Sasaki forcefully made me wore her heirloom suit for the jump back home. Actually it's mine now, never mind that Sasaki will kill me if I dared mess with it. It's probably bugged.

The trans-dimensional machine was ready for transport and Sasaki's already in the passenger seat next to me. Otherwise, Diana was beside me for morale support, while we were surrounded by Sidonian researchers and engineers, along with captain Kobayashi and her security service.

"It's time to go," I said.

"Love you," Diana replied.

I walked into the hangar as the crowd retreated back. There shouldn't be anything happening after Sasaki and I left.

Once I entered the cramped interior of the trans-dimensional machine, Sasaki started yappering her mouth on checklists and standard operating procedures.

"I know! I know!" I said.

"It got to be a habit," Sasaki reminded me.

"I already do checklists."

"Your old checklist sucked."

I grumbled as I went through the checklist on the tablet, many of which were added by Sasaki herself.

After twenty minutes or so making sure everything's alright, we finally were ready to jump.

"Ready?" I asked once again.

"Ready."

Then we jumped.
