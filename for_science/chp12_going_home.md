##Chief Engineer Sasaki

In the airless vacuum of space, an audience of watchers in EVA(extravehicular activity) suits was present on a test site, together with an archaic gun custom built to order and a piece of armor downrange.

"We are now on Test Zero Twenty One, M829 APFSDS tank round for the 120mm M256 smoothbore tank gun designed in the latest twenty century about a thousand years ago, give or take," Sasaki announced to her audience. "Three two one, fire in the hole!"

The gun fired off a round on the surface of Sidonia, striking a piece of armor that Sasaki wanted so badly as armor on the trans-dimensional machine.

The round strike the test range, shredding itself into a cloud of dust. There was nothing on the armor itself; a testament to thousand years of armor evolution.

"Now can you see why?" Sasaki said to Diana's boyfriend. Said boyfriend went slackjawed for a moment before composing himself.

"A gun from an Abram tank?" Archer asked.

"A replica faithfully reproduced according to design, and it's on the lower end of the spectrum of what we have available. We have a lot of knowledge from deep time." Nothing on twenty-first century Earth could possibly match the Sidonian in military technology of course.

"I...want it."

"Of course you do, and you're going to let me rebuild the damn thing."

"James, please. If they're going to sabtagoe your ship, why wait?" Diana Rose offered her council.

"Damn right. I am going to be sitting in your machine, transiting to who know where. I preferred that the machine is up to Sidonian military engineering," Sasaki concurred.

Finally, the male sighed in defeat. "Fine. But you're going to teach the both of us how it work."

Sasaki smiled. "Of course. And you mister, are going to teach me everything about trans-dimensional theory and explain in detail about how the damn thing works."

## James Archer

Dear journal,

As a result of Kobayashi, I was determined to be on bad term with Sidonia, to make it clear that I don't like coercion, but that determination didn't last. The people of Sidonia behaved the same as before and Sasaki in particular proved to be particularly good in wearing me down, which led to the mending of my relationship with my significant other.

That woman, along with my girlfriend of course forced me to see reason. It would not be in her interest in laying down traps in the very same vehicle that she will occupy when we travel back to Earth.
