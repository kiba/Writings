##Chief Engineer Sasaki

In the airless vacuum of space, an audience of aobut three was present on a test site, together with an archaic gun custom built to order and a piece of armor downrange.

"We are now on Test Zero Twenty One, M829 APFSDS tank round for the 120mm M256 smoothbore tank gun designed in the latest twenty century about a thousand years ago, give or take," Sasaki announced to her audience. "Three two one, fire in the hole!"

The gun fired off a round on the surface of Sidonia, striking a piece of armor that Sasaki wanted so badly as armor on the trans-dimensional machine.

The round strike the test range, shredding itself into a cloud of dust. There was nothing on the armor itself; a testament to thousand years of armor evolution.

"Now can you see why?" Sasaki said to Diana's boyfriend. Said boyfriend went slackjawed for a moment before composing himself.

"A gun from an Abram tank?" Archer asked.

"A replica faithfully reproduced according to design, and it's on the lower end of the spectrum of what we have available. We have a lot of knowledge from deep time." Nothing on twenty-first century Earth could possibly match the Sidonian in military technology of course.

"I...want it."

"Of course you do, and you're going to let me rebuild the damn thing."

"James, please. If they're going to sabtagoe your ship, why wait?" Diana Rose offered her council.

"Damn right. I am going to be sitting in your machine, transiting to who know where. I preferred that the machine is up to Sidonian military engineering," Sasaki concurred.

Finally, the male sighed in defeat. "Fine. But you're going to teach the both of us how it work."

Sasaki smiled. "Of course. And you mister, are going to teach me everything about trans-dimensional theory and explain in detail about how the damn thing works."

*Dear journal,

As a result of Captain Kobayashi, I was determined to be on bad term with Sidonia, to make it clear that I don't like coercion, but that determination didn't last. The people of Sidonia behaved the same as before and Sasaki in particular proved to be particularly good in wearing me down, which led to a demonstration of the armor that they use.

Which then finally led to the mending of my relationship with my significant other.

That woman, along with my girlfriend of course forced me to see reason. It would not be in her interest in laying down traps in the very same vehicle that she will occupy when we travel back to Earth.

On the other hand, I couldn't rule out bugs that Sidonia might have left on the machine itself.

I am looking forward to whatever design that they cooked up. It would be quick and dirty by their standard, but it should be good enough to get me and Sasaki home. Though, I will miss Rose. That shouldn't be much of a problem since it's a short stomach churning hop away*

## **Captain Kobayashi**

Kobayashi was without her mask, as that was standard when talking to a fellow immortal. They're all in on the secret anyway. Together, Kobayashi was standing in a discreet hallway with Sasaki.

"Sasaki," she said. "The security team may have missed a spot with their interrogation video."

"You're asking me to spy?"

"I don't want you implanting bugs and jeopardizing their trust."

"I can't do it, but security can?"

"I am not training you in spycraft, but it would be prudent to have someone that they can trust unconditonally. I just want the story on this particular footage."

Sasaki watched the annotated video, before finally commenting. "Their story wasn't altogether air-tight."

"This is one of the secrets that they kept a tight lip, but we weren't able to ferret out given our inexperience.nn"

"But if you're asking me to spy on them but build trust from them...isn't that opposite. It would be better if somebody else do it. However, I  think I can report on the questions that they ask of me. It's their secret to tell."

"You're right. That's all I ask. But don't promise what you can't keep. This is probably the last video that I will show to you."

"I'll make sure of that, Captain."

## **James Archer**

It took a little over three days, but they finally done it! Or Sasaki and her team did. I, along with Diana mostly bother them and ask questions. It's a little bit of not trusting them and wanting to be knowledgable about the craft that I am using it to transit between worlds.

"It didn't look like something out of Mad Max," Diana commented.

"I like that look, but I admit that I do like what it looked like now."

It looked like what NASA might have made, with its pure industrial look and no frills, different from the sheet metals Diana and I cobbled up when the last time we did an upgrade.

"Let's check the inside."

I nodded.

The trans-dimensional machine grew larger slightly, and it was less cramped than before, but not by much. The main limitation being the bubble size surrounding the space-time generator.

The inside looked like the internals of the international space station, jam packed with god knows what. It was both messy and organized. I tried to keep up with the details but I couldn't keep up with what Sasaki wanted to install.

"Cramped as usual," she said.

"I doubt that's going to change if we make the vehicle bigger than it is now."

Ideas cycled through my mind as I thought about the idea of building smaller vehicles and devices to complement the trans-dimensional machine, because as of now, it's going to stand out a lot. Smaller vehicles would be harder to spot.

"Is it the same machine?"

I shrugged. "Maybe. Pretty much everything is replaced but the actual electronics for transiting between worlds."

"So it's an entirely new machine then."

"Maybe."

This was supposed to be a quick stop-gap to make the machine safer for their occupants. I am pretty sure that that they're going to design something proper for themselves, given that I keep insisting on making my own design after I learned all of this. They weren't convinced of my ship engineering expertise, to say the least.

"These are old extra-vehicular suits," Sasaki said, explaining to her ancestors from a parallel dimension. "Family heirloom. I expect you two to take good care of it."
