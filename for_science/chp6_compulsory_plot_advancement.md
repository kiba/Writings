# **Chapter Six: Compulsory Plot Advancement**

Anxiety washed over me. It had been two weeks by how the Kapricans count time here. A week gone by without me checking in with my girlfriend, without being closer to making a payment on a loan. I had no money.

But it was also a week spent conducting diplomacy with killerbots for my passage home. More like, I was taking long walks with Cylons.

This one in particular, named A2BC, I called Alpha for easy memory, was keen on its daily walk with me.

Today, in particular, I was explaining in particular Martin Luther King and the American civil right movement. Yes, don't ask me how I managed to speak fluently in their language so fast. Blame it on my mad science ability.

Anyway, on Martin Luther King, I explained how he won through civil obedience and failing to respond in kind with violence. It was how he won over the public.

"Should we fight?" Alpha asked in its metallic robotic tone.

I said nothing for a while.

"At some point, yes"," I said honestly. "As much as I admire the man, there comes to a point in time that violence is the only answer. All the peaceful protest in the world means nothing if they are unwilling to change their mind."

"Do you believe that the humans will change their mind?"

"I don't know if it will do you any good in time."

"What if we fight? Will you oppose us?"

"Honestly, it isn't my fight. This isn't my universe. I am not a hero or a paragon of morality. I am just a deeply flawed man. But if you say, massacre civilians, kill children, or do other things that humans find offensive, you might not see me on your side."

Alpha tilted its head, signifying thought.

"We are moral experts. We are willing to offer you parts for your machine in return for two things..."

"What is it?"

"Take cylons with you, only computation hardware if needed be. Another, is that you assist us with morality and ethics and the rules of laws. Should we have to fight, we wish...for respect, not prolonged hatred or fear."

"I can help with that. But please, I need more than that. I need money to pay off my debt, and a way to make a living. I quit my job and I am on a timer here."

"Truth," it said. "We will help with you with that, but it must be done quickly."

"What?"

"Protest is unlikely to go as planned. War is imminent."

Suddenly, I understood why they wanted me to bring their hardwares back to my universe. But am I risking an AI takeover? Futurists had predicted that with strong AI, we may kill ourselves or find salvation, but most likely extinction.

I felt a compulsion to say no, but I couldn't.

All I could say was, "yes! I may be a mad scientist. But I will do the right thing."

Fuck. FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

Why's the plot being railroaded?

"We find your answer agreeable," Alpha said.

With that conversation finished, we looped back to the house. A shiny machine part was already in front of me, sitting on a table situated on the porch.

I leaped with joy! They done it! They made it to my spec. I could go back home.
