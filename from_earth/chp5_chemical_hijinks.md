# **Chp5 Chemcial Hijinks**

Dust was all kind of bullshit. It was so much bullshit that Remnan engineers cannot think without using dusts in some form or another. That wasn't to say that chemistry didn't exist. They do, but they are strangled by dust. Almost any chemical process apart from the most basic required dusts of some kind to do the job.

So Sam was forced to reinvent chemistry from scratch. He had a lot of help from his photographic memory of the dust chemistry books he read, but his memories apparently didn't include any information from wikipedia on how to do chemistry. Worse, Sam wasn't a chemist at all.

Not that wikipedia was actually suited to that kind of things. By the way, what the hell was wikipedia? It must be an encyclopedia of some kind.

In any case, Sam Xiao Long was apparently a walking and talking Earth historical database, of which wikipedia was only one source among many, and only as a starting point. There were concepts hidden and embedded into his knowledge, but they weren't exactly recipes.

He knew what was important, but not how those inventions work in details. Despite the photographic memories, it did not actually mean that he understood what he was supposed to do.

Nonetheless, Sam found himself in a dusty shed working out a chemical process to synthesize rocket fuel.

"What ya doing, bro?" Ruby asked.

"Wha!?" Sam shouted. "Rube, you almost scared me!"

"Sorry!" she sincerely apologized.

"Anyway, for your information, I am making rocket fuels."

"Really? What dust forumulation you're using?"

"Silly Ruby, I am not using any dust."

"That's impossible! You can't do anything without dust!"

"That's where you're wrong, Ruby. Have you ever notice how firewoods and trees burn? They don't require dust. Same principle apply here. You can do things without dust."

"I think you're baloony."

Then something ignited.

"FUCK!" Sam yelled. "Get out of here!"

Ruby pulled Sam out of the shed, using her semblance, pushing both away at a safe distance.

It didn't take long before the shed unceremoniously lit on fire.

"We're so in trouble," Ruby commented.

"Yep."

[B]A Week later[/B]

Taiyang was not happy that he found out that Sam was doing dangerous things and that Ruby was accomplice to her sibling's shenanigan.

Nonetheless, Sam from banned from experimenting with alchemy, among short term punishments such as network restriction, and no video games.

He didn't know what caused the fire in the first place, but father told him if he wanted to learn alchemy, Sam would need to enroll in university where it would be safe to do it.

Not that Sam planned to. Away from home, at his favorite cafe, he was planning something different.

It was a plan that doesn't rely entirely on him reinventing Earth concepts to enable the spaceflight capability, or worse, running an entire organization and pushing it every day.

Sam wrote out a few lines on his notebook, outlining the names of historical personalities and projects, like 'Elon Musk', "SpaceX", and 'Apollo'.

He estimated that it would take ten years from initiation to launch a rocket into low earth orbit using Remnant's technological and scientific know-how.

It wasn't like they lacked physics or engineering knowledge. Sam checked, and it was more than enough to do the job. It still will push the boundary of their science and engineering, especially since they will have to reinvent chemistry without the use of dust if they want to make it beyond the planet's atmosphere, since dusts as an energy source stopped working above a certain altitude.

That wasn't the hard part, actually. The hard part was getting the people of Remnant to support such a non-obviously beneficial project. It was hard enough back in Earth's history. The Apollo project was opposed by the American public until the moon landing.

He was working on one part of political persuasion, by writing dreams.

Future fiction(Sci-fi for us Earth-folks) was a genre that was on the lowest bottom of the fiction totem, meant for 'kids' or 'light fun' much like how comics in his memories was derided as a non-serious medium.

Of course, he was changing all of that, by cranking the temperature and seriousness past the editor's perception. That was hard, and annoying.

As a result, the [i]Future Fiction of Vale[/i] magazine was getting readers that it wouldn't otherwise get.

It was one exploit that he found in the world of Remnant and it took two years. Two years of recovery and two years to get his bearing.

For sure, there wasn't a whole lot of way to munchkin this reality, even with an estimated global population smaller than the United States.

"Hello," a female voice said.

Sam was startled, almost knocking off his cup of coffee.

"Whoa!" he said.

He gotten a good look at the unexpected. It was a girl somewhere around his age, who apparently have a love of brownness. Indeed, her eyes were dark brown, as her hair. Otherwise, she was pale white.

"My name's Coco Adel, and I am a third year student at Patch Academy. I liked how you look. Where did you buy those? What's your name?"

"Sam Xiao Long," he said. "I have peculiar tastes in clothes, that's all." It took Sam all he had not to discuss Coco's name. It sounded like a cereal brand.

"You must be Xiao Long's brother that I keep hearing about!"

"Did she really talk about me a lot."

"Hmmm....not too much. But it was interesting. And I like interesting people!"

"Really? I am not a huntsman-in-training."

"That's ok! Not every boyfriend material needs to be a badass."

"B-b-boyfriend?"

"Yes, why not?"

"Don't we have to date first?"

"Of course we'll do that first now."

Without skipping a beat, she took out her scroll and paired it to the writer's.

"Huh?"

"You're available tomorrow? How about 9 PM here?"

"Yes," Sam blurted out.

"Great! See ya then! I got practice."

She left before Sam could object. Did he just accept a date just like that. Well, she was hot.

Sam arrived home only to find Yang waiting. Ruby was somewhere with her uncle.

"How was your day?" Yang asked. She made a wrinkle which Sam noticed immediately.

"YOU SET ME UP!" Sam concluded.

"What did I do?" Yang said.

"It was your friend Coco Adel you set me up with."

Yang smirked. "Nah, as your sister, I would never do that." There was a lot of sarcasm dripping in her words.

"WHY?!" Sam tried chasing after her, but Yang wasn't about to let Sam win.

"You know why!"

Introspect, Sam didn't know why he was so angry with her sister. He gotten a date with a hot chick after all, even if it was almost a blind date.
