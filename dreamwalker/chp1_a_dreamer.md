# Chapter One: A Dreamer
[todo]Make it scarier somehow.[/todo]
I ran through the forest as hard as I could.

My lung really hurt, screaming for air.

I didn't even know why I am running.

Just that I am scared.

A series of growl echoed throughout the forest.

It was the horde.

I hit my foot against a tree, sending pain upward. I didn't stop. A slip there, a stabbing pain in my left arm, and a tiny rock in my shoe.

It didn't matter. I just kept running.

I didn't want to get caught by the horde.

Who is the horde?

I didn't know that either. The overwhelming fear propelled me regardless.

Thud. Thud. Crack. They're getting closer.

I slipped and fell, striking a rock with my forehead.

Ouch!

More cracking and snapping. They're getting closer.

I desperately struggled to find my footing.

A loud roar vibrated through my body. I turned around.

A giant claw swiped at me.

I screamed as I woke up. Moments later, the door swung open to my mother.

"What's wrong, honey?" she asked as she switched on the light. I could see the blond form of my mother in her pajamas.

I noticed that I was visibly in sweating. Then I checked my own body for signs of injuries. I was relieved that nothing happened to me.

"A very vivid nightmare," I said. "I ran through a forest trying to get away from some monsters."

"Night terror."

"Yeah. I think that's it. I don't even know what I am running from."

"Child, I don't know what to do. If this keeps up, we're going to get a doctor's appointment. See the sleep doctor, maybe?"

"But-"

"No but! I am not going to have a son with constant night terror in my house, especially when he disturbs my sleep. Do you want to die in a traffic accident?"

"No, mom."

"Go to sleep."

"Yes ma'am."

Thinking that it's over, I fell asleep again.

"We're losing him!"

...

"Based on the genetic profile, the only identification method we have left, we have an unknown John Doe," a female voice said.

"He's not in the system at all?" another voice puzzled.

"There are some individuals who opted not to register themselves and their children with the government, especially after Unification Day. It's possible that he might be one of them."

...

"There are antibodies that we cannot identify..."

I finally woke up to a strong white light. Beeping noise pervades my ears, as did the various transparent plastic tubes that seemed to poke everywhere into my body.

Why was am I in a hospital?

I tried to wriggle. It seemed that I can't move, and moreover, I am encased in a full body cast. I tried to recall what happened.

Oh yeah. I had a horrible nightmare last night. Then I woke up. Mom and I talked, and she threatened doctor appointment if this kept up. Then I went to bed.

But how did I get there? The only thing that came to mind was the possibility of a car accident. Mom said something about that last night, but I don't remember getting into a car and crashing. What day is it? Where's my mom?

I did the only thing I think I could. I pivoted with my eyes, trying to get a look good of my surrounding.

There were recognizable writings and symbols. The computers looked kinda weird.

"Help??!" I yelled, testing my voice. "HELP?!"

Someone in a hazmat suit walked in.

"Where the hell am I? What day it is?"

"John Doe, please calm down," the hazmat man said as he pull the bed into a recline position. "You were in a serious vehicular accident. The confusion is normal, but we will help you get through that, but you'll have to cooperate with us. Do you understand?"

"Um, yes."

The hazmat suit shined a light into my eyes.

"What is your name?"

"Andy Watson."

"Alright, Mrs. Watson. I am Doctor Berry Spring and I will be caring for you." A couple more of hazmat suits came in at the same time, with a cart as well. "Don't worry. They're nurses." I can even see the prepared food on top of the cart. It wasn't recognizable to me though. "Do you know what year it is?"

"Two thousand sixteen?"

"Excuse me?"

"Two thousand sixteen yanno anno?"

"You're a little bit off. Less then two thousand years after landing. And I don't know what 'yanno anno' is." The doctor then put an earbud into one of my ear. "Say yes if you hear a beep." There were a series of beep in which I successfully answered. "Good, it looked like your hearing is not compromised. Now, the year is nineteen thousand twenty five after landing."

"Excuse me? Landing what?"

"You don't remember your history? The important thing is that you are aware and lucid, I guess. More questions. Two plus two is?"

"Four."

"Name the thirteen worlds of man."

"What? Since when the solar system has thirteen worlds?"

The doctor sighed. "Are you a cultist?"

"What? No! I don't even believe in God!" The occasional beeps nearby became full long beep. "Gah-"

"we got a cardiac arrest!" the doctor yelled one last time.

My vision turned all blurry, and then to black. I blanked out.

I woke up, jumping out of my bed.

"What the fuck?!" I yelled to no one in particular.

"You're being awfully loud up there!" mom yelled.

I turned around, taking a quick look at everything in rapid succession. Then I grabbed my android, and flip it on. It was a brand new day, January fourteen, two thousand sixteen. I hadn't gone back in the past, did I?

No. It was really vivid. I still remembered the nightmare, and then talking to my mom, and then ending up in a weird hospital with doctors that ask weird questions. The frightening thing was that it all weirdly made sense. Dreams aren't supposed to make sense.

"Breakfast ready!" my mom hollered.

"I'm coming!" I reflexively yelled back.

As soon as I came down, I can see the dishes laid on the table. There's eggs and bacons, with buttered bread and jam, and pancakes with syrup, milk and orange, and everything that I could possibly want in a breakfast.

Nobody put as much effort into breakfast like my mom.

Still, there's something I must communicate before sitting down to eat breakfast.

"Mom?" I pressed for her attention.

"Yes?"

"My dreams...felt so real?"
