# Chapter One: A Dreamer

I ran for my life into the forest.

I didn't even know why I am running.

Just that I am very scared.

A series of deafening growl echoed throughout the forest.

It was the horde.

I hit my foot against a tree, sending pain upward. I didn't stop.

A slip there, a stabbing pain in my left arm, with a rock in my shoe. I kept running.
