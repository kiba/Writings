# Chapter One: A Dreamer

I ran through a forest.

I didn't even know why I am running.

Just that I am very scared.

A series of growl echoed throughout the forest.

It was the horde.

I hit my foot against a tree, sending pain upward. I didn't stop. A slip there, a stabbing pain in my left arm, with a rock in my shoe.

It didn't matter. I just kept running.

I didn't want to get caught by the horde.

Who is the horde?

I didn't know that either. The overwhelming fear propelled me regardless.

Thud. Thud. Crack. They're getting closer.

I slipped, striking a rock with my forehead.

Ouch!

More cracking and snapping. They're getting closer.

I desperately struggled to find my footing.

A loud roar vibrated through my body. I turned around.

I didn't even have a good look before a giant claw swiped at me.

***

I screamed as I woke up. Moments later, the door swung open to my mother.

"What's wrong, honey?" she asked as she switched on the light. I could see the blond form of my mother in her sleep grown.

I noticed that I was visibly in sweating. Then I checked my bodies for signs of injuries.

"A very vivid nightmare," I said. "I ran through a forest trying to get away from some monsters."

"Night terror."

"Yeah. I think that's it."

"Child, I don't know what to do. If this keeps up, we're going to get a doctor's appointment. I am going to do research this morning."

"But-"

"No but! I am not going to have a son with night terror in my house, especially when he disturbs my sleep. Do you want to die in a traffic accident."

"No, mom."

"Get back to sleep."

"Yes ma'am."

Thinking that it's over, I fell asleep again.

"We're losing him!"

...

"Based on the genetic profile, we have an unknown John Doe," a female voice said.

"He's not in the system at all?" another voice puzzled.

"There are some individuals who opted not to register themselves and their children with the government. It's possible that he might be one of them."

...

"There are antibodies that we cannot identify..."

...

I finally woke up to a strong white light. Beeping noise pervades my ears, as did the various transparent plastic tubes that seemed to poke everywhere into my body.

Why was am I in a hospital?

I tried to wriggle. It seemed that I can't move, and moreover, I am encased in a full body cast. I tried to recall what happened.

Oh yeah. I had a horrible nightmare last night. Then I woke up. Mom and I talked, and she threatened doctor appointment if this kept up. Then I went to bed.

But how did I get there? The only thing that came to mind was the possibility of a car accident. Mom said something about that last night, but I don't remember getting into a car and crashing. What day is it? Where's my mom?

I did the only thing I think I could. I pivoted with my eyes, trying to get a look good of my surrounding.

There were recognizable writings and symbols. The computers looked kinda weird.

"Help??!" I yelled, testing my voice. "HELP?!"

Someone in a hazmat suit walked in.

"Where the hell am I? What day it is?"

"John Doe, hold on," the hazmat man said as he pull the bed into a recline position. "We'll ask you a question. You'll try to answer ours. We will also need to run some medical diagnostic on you. Do you understand?"

"Um, yes."

The hazmat suit shined a light into my eyes.

"What is your name?"

"Andy Watson."

"Alright, Mrs. Watson. I am Doctor Jerry Spring and I will be caring for you." A couple more of hazmat suits came in at the same time, with a cart as well, and with what looked like food as well on top of the cart. "Do you know what year it is?"

"Two thousand sixteen?"

"Excuse me?"

"Two thousand sixteen yanno anno?"

"I don't understand. That's not remotely the year we're in." The doctor then puts an earbud into one of my ear. "Say yes if you hear a beep." There were a series of beep in which I successfully answered. "Good, it looked like your hearing is not compromised. Now, the year is three thousand twenty-five after landing."

"Excuse me? Landing what?"

"You don't remember your history? The important thing is that you are aware. Let see if the crash didn't make you any more bonker. Two plus two is?"

"Four."

"Name the thirteen gods."

"What? From what pantheon?"
