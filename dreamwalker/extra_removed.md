* **Diaspora of the Stars** - **DS** for short. A space opera taking place in the Andromeda galaxy. Our protagonist appeared in this setting thirty years before the fall and twenty years after the first contact war. Current population is fifty-six billions.

Civilization and culture is somewhat influenced by Norse mythology. The Nine Worlds of Man consist of Niflheim, Muspelheim, Asgard, Midgard, Jotunheim, Vanaheim, Alfheim, Svartalfheim, and Helheim.

Anti-aging drugs and therapies are available for humans, extending their lifespan up to a projected two hundred year. Research is ongoing to increase and improve interventions.

The First Contact War begins in year three of an ongoing multi-way war between the various human polity and rebelling synthetic intelligence. Unknown aliens did not parlay or hail, and began exterminating any belligerents in the AI war, forcing a coalition and a forceful unification of mankind and their creation for their survival.

After twelve long years of bitter fighting, the aliens agreed to an armistice after a brutal orbital bombardment of one of the alien's colony.

The fall entails the destruction of the civilization of the Nine World of Man by the same alien who initiated the first contact war. After that, the aliens began a campaign of total xenocide by hunting the survivors. The story of the DS would begin there, with one of the escaping refugee fleet.
