**Dreamwalker** - A person who travel the multiverse through the mechanism of dreaming and sleeping.

When a person 'dreamwalk'(an involuntary process), that person connects to a person who is a resident of a different reality, which is referred to as another instance of oneself. Typically this would be a person with the same name, basic personality, even the same DNA.

This 'connection' is typically a two-way download and upload of long-term memories obtained via sleeping and dreaming, exhibited as unusually high level of neural activity.

Death of an instance will result in intense negative biofeedback, such as phantom sharp pains, rapid heartbeats, nightmare, and so on. It also result in a permanent connection loss, since the person who resided in that universe is considered 'dead'. Finally, it will result in the creation of a new instance ex nihilo in a new universe.

The three basic magic of a dreamwalker, accessible to all 'dream' world are crafting, materalization, and projection.

## Materalization

**Materialization** is ability to create matter ex nihilo starting with a small amount of elemental substance at ambient condition. For beginners, they can only create a milliliter of hydrogen within a twenty-four hours period. With practice and training, it is possible to improve the versatility of this skill.

These are the factors that a dreamwalker may change:

* Cooldown - time required before a person can create matters again. Level one is twenty-four hours period. It decreases by one hour with a point increase.
* Volume - The amount of substance one could materialize. Level one is one milliliter. Every point increase is a milliliter increase.
* Temperature - the ability to decrease or increase the temperature of an object. Level one is one degree celsius. Every increase brings a one celsius increase in control.
* Composition - The ability to create a given elemental substance. Level one is hydrogen. Further increase gives an additional element to summon based on its atomic number.
* Pressure - Default of a substance summoned is equal to the ambient pressure of the environment. With each increasing level, the amount of pressure can be changed go up by one pascal.
* Velocity - The default velocity of a substance is exactly zero meter per second relative to you. With increasing level, the ability to impart a different velocity go up by one meter per second.

## Projection

The ability to project another instance of oneself or summon an object on another instance' person or near that instance.

These are the factors that a dreamwalker may change:

* Distance - A person may summon a person only if it's on another instance's body. With increasing level, the radius can be increased by one meter.
* Time - A projected person can only last one minute, but with each new level, it can be increased by one minute.
* Item count - Limited to one item at a time between uses of projection, but with each new level, the amount of items increase.
* Cooldown - One can only use projection every twenty-four hour period, but with new level, that can be decrease by one hour until it reaches one hour between projection. Then with each new level, it can only be decrease by one minute.

## Crafting

The ability to craft or create an object instantly by gathering the necessary materials and tools and conducting a rituals. To acquire a new recipe, a person must first acquire the necessary skill and create the target object at least once.
