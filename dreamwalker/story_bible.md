## History

Even today, there are ruins and buildings that can be explored, and lost knowledge that could be recovered.

* The Long Winter - caused by a powerful volcanic eruption on the other side of the world, leading to many years of long winters. The winters wreck havoc on agricultural productivity and human population, leading to famine and starvation, and then wars. The wars further deplete agriculture surplus and infrastructure.

* Warring States - Period of prolonged and constant warfare until the emergence of hidden villages and kingdoms.

* Antebellum - Twenty years of peace. Tension rises between the various kingdoms until the outbreak of war.

* First Ninja World War - A brutal and short lived continent wide war that ended just when Yuu Katsurou was born. The Kingdom of Kurisutaru was forced to cede land to the Emerald kingdom.
