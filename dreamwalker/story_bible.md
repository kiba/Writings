## World
* The Kurisutaru Kingdom - land that the Katsurou family rules. Its major resources are precious minerals and gemstones, hotsprings, and lush agricultural land stemming from rich soils created by volcanic activities. It also has access to the ocean through its coasts, and it is connected to the rest of the nations through the Green river. Luckily, for defense, it is also protected by a mountain range that virtually surrounded the entire nation's territorial claim. It is a very small nation, about only two thousand six hundred squared kilometer, one-eighth of our world's Israel.

## History

Even today, there are ruins and buildings that can be explored, and lost knowledge that could be recovered.

* The Long Winter - caused by a powerful volcanic eruption on the other side of the world, leading to many years of long winters. The winters wreck havoc on agricultural productivity and human population, leading to famine and starvation, and then wars. The wars further deplete agriculture surplus and infrastructure.

* Antebellum - Twenty years of peace. Tension rises between the various kingdoms until the outbreak of war.

* First Ninja World War - A brutal and short lived continental wide war that ended just when Yuu Katsurou was born. The Kingdom of Kurisutaru was forced to cede land to the Emerald kingdom.
