**Dreamwalker** - A person who travel the multiverse through the mechanism of dreaming and sleeping.

When a person 'dreamwalk'(an involuntary process), that person connects to a person who is a resident of a different reality, which is referred to as another instance of oneself. Typically this would be a person with the same name, basic personality, even the same DNA.

This 'connection' is typically a two-way download and upload of long-term memories obtained via sleeping and dreaming, exhibited as unusually high level of neural activity.

Death of an instance will result in intense negative biofeedback, such as phantom sharp pains, rapid heartbeats, nightmare, and so on. It also result in a permanent connection loss, since the person who resided in that universe is considered 'dead'. Finally, it will result in the creation of a new instance ex nihilo in a new universe.

The three basic magic of a dreamwalker, accessible to all 'dream' world are crafting, materialization, and projection. Those magics are not flashy or all that powerful at first, but  with practice and training, it is possible to improve the versatility and power of dreamwalker magic.

## Materialization

**Materialization** is ability to create matter ex nihilo starting with a small amount of elemental substance at ambient condition.

These are the factors that a dreamwalker may change:

* **Cooldown** -At level one, materialization can only be used once every twenty-four hour or longer. An increment in level will bring the cooldown period by one hour until level twenty-three. Then, every subsequent increase in level will decrease the cooldown period by one minute.
* **Volume** - The amount of substance one could materialize. At level one, that is one milliliter. An increment in level brings an additional milliliter available for creation.
* **Temperature** - Substance assumed ambient temperature unless otherwise changed by user, with level one at one degree celsius from starting temperature. An increment in level brings an additional one degree celsius for control.
* **Elemental substance** - All dreamwalkers start at level one with hydrogen. An increment in level gives a new substance to create based on its atomic number.
* **Pressure** - A substance summoned will default to the ambient pressure of the surrounding environment. An increment in level imparts additional control of one pascal of pressure.
* **Velocity** - The default velocity of a substance is exactly zero meter per second relative to you. With an increment in level, the ability to impart a different velocity go up by one meter per second.

Any points spent on materialization will increase the cost of an additional level by one. Unless stated otherwise, all factors in the skill materialization start at level one.

## Projection

The ability to project another instance of oneself or summon an object on another instance' person or near that instance.

These are the factors that a dreamwalker may change:

* **Distance** - A person may summon a person only if it's on another instance's body. With increasing level, the radius can be increased by one meter.
* **Time** - A projected person can only last one minute, but with each new level, it can be increased by one minute.
* **Item count** - Initially limited to one item at a time between uses of projection, but with each new level, the amount of items increase.
* **Cooldown** - One can only use projection every twenty-four hour period, but with each new level, that can be decrease by one hour until it reaches one hour between projection. Then with each new level, it can only be decrease by one minute.

Any points spent on materialization will increase the cost of an additional level by one. Unless stated otherwise, all factors in the skill projection start at level one.

## Crafting
