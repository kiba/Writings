# Fire: A Brief History

Fire is a peculiar form of magic that's only available to man. Like all magic, it can bend and break the laws of physics to create miraculous effects. Whereas other races and species use magic freely, man struggled under its weighty requirement; strong will and determination.

Nobody knows who were the first Fire users are, but we could probably guess how they discovered it.

In the beginning, there was no cities, towns, or settlements. However, monsters and beasts stalked the land.

Mankind has no poison, claws, or much of any defensive ability. What they do have in spade is ingenuity. Man fashioned clothing, tools, and weapons from the animal he hunted. Sometime, he even harvested poison to use against the savagery of nature.

However, ingenuity wasn't always enough. Monsters are still more powerful than man. On occasion, a tribe would be wiped out or hunted to the very last person. Other time, there would be a few survivors.

It is in those moments that the display of courage and heroism would be felt. Through the sheer force of will and determination, a hero might achieve victory, or they might die in the attempt.

Those who survived their moments of heroism would obtained Fire.

It wasn't unsurprising that Fire was strongly associated with heroism for as long as we could remember.

Fire, however, was very difficult to obtain, and with so few Fire practitioners, any knowledge or kernel of insight was easily lost.

Mankind did not understand how to obtain Fire for a long time. There were all sort of rituals associated with Fire, and many tales on how to obtain Fire, but they all ultimately did nothing.

Occasionally, there would be entire dynasties found on a Fire user, even with the belief that Fire would pass from one generation to the next. It must be hereditary.

It is true that Fire was hereditary, but people misunderstood that it was limited to a few people. Fire is invariant in humanity. Just as every living breathing human has a lung, so does every human being has Fire. It existed as potential in all of us, with almost no exception. It neither care about a person's pedigree or crime that one had committed, nor physical status or gender, or mental health.

In that case, there was nothing special about a person's family in term of having Fire in their blood.

One just needed a mind, and an enormous burst of willpower and determination.

Anyone could become a Fire user, but that was easier said then done.

It would take thousand of years for Fire to truly become more than mythological.

The study of Fire first truly got started in monasteries, in particular, the monks' dedication to ascetic training and martial arts. Whether it was punching water barrels all morning, constant mediation, or complete focus through on plucking small objects with eyelids and moving those around, it didn't matter their training methods. Years after years of practice eventually led them to reliably achieve Fire.

With reliability came the prospect of study, systemization, and demysterization. When the monks achieved those abilities, the monasteries became the center of learning. Many would come to study under the monks, but very few were able to endure the lifestyle.

Nonetheless, for as long as the monasteries were not molested by those who bear ill intention, their library would continue to accumulate magical knowledge generations after generations.

It wasn't until the Age of Dragons that the study of Fire took off.

No one knew why the dragons decided to become a benefactor of humanity, but it was rumored that a monk took care of a heavily injured dragon. In recognition of the monk's kindness, the dragon offered a boon. The monk answered that humanity would live in peace and harmony with each other. Rather than rejecting the wish, the Dragon saw that the wish was very worthy in itself.

Whatever the truth may be, the dragons conquered and annexed the kingdoms in only two decades.

Over the next two centuries, humanity flourished under their rule and benevolence. With the state's support and a large bureaucracy class, many fields of study flourished. With greater agricultural productivity, population exploded.

With a cycle of virtue, the study of Fire flourished dramatically in this golden age. Religious connotation and ceremonies were stripped away until humanity discovered the core essential truth of obtaining Fire as we had discussed before.

Fire was also no longer limited to the domain of monks or chakra warriors. Fire users' imagination ran high. They begun to access their techniques for civilian applications, whether it was something as grand as civil engineering, or as mundane and domestic as cooking.

Far from extinguishing the Fire of humanity, peace instead strengthened the Fire.

It was not inevitable that civilizations would fall, but the dragons are far from omnipotent, nor perfect, but they were imperfect enough that the fall did came. All was not well under the dragons' rule during the last few decades of their rule. Whether it was the observance of the dragons's daily feast and the long line of taxation wagons that feed their temples, or the opulence of their treasure, or their patronage of the bureaucracy; envy, greed, and suspicion grew. Religious fervor against the dragons festered and flourished.

Contrary to popular beliefs, the antebellum time was a period of great prosperity. People did not suffer for the want of food, or goods they could buy. Technology and science steadfastly improve the economy, but those introduced drastic changes to society. It must have alarmed the power structure that was in place since the beginning of the dragon age.

Discontent eventually broke into war. The samurai class, which by then had thrown away their swords in favor of becoming a new set of nobility, rallied their armies and their Fire users. Their armies met the dragons and their servants on the battlefields, in the dragons' temples, and in the cities and settlements.

Nobody knew how to fight wars by then, but the centuries of peace has cultivated Fire into a terrible weapon. Horrific casualties quickly mounted with the destruction of the environment around them. Ironically,t he worst offenders were the fire users. Sheer determination overcame their sense of self-preservation, and they would frequently fight to the death.

Of course, with countless battles, sieges, and skirmishes, the armies relearned their skills, but that
was rendered irrelevant by the collapsing logistics. When the samurai lords cannot pay their soldiers, armies often devolved into bandits, looting everything around them, further destroying sustainability.

The years of war eventually driven out the dragons, but the victory was absolutely worthless. Libraries and monasteries were ransacked and destroyed. Famine and diseases spread across the land. Hordes of beasts and monsters invaded the kingdoms, destroying what's left of the aftermath, plunging the kingdoms into a new dark age.

With the population crash, Fire users declined in number and efficacy. Fire masters who survived frequently could not find apprentices, and often found themselves too busy trying to survive.

The great majority of the blame went to the samurai nobility, regardless of which side they were on. From then on, the word 'samurai' was a cause for disdain and disgust.

Of the Fire users that survived the war, ninjas were the most numerous. Ninjas emerged in the warring states period, doing jobs that most samurai find distasteful, such as spying and assassinations. They were open to everyone, regardless of their class. After the ennoblement of samurais, which restricted their Fire users further, the ninjas expanded the kind of jobs they will do, even as they were forced to abandon certain jobs as being illegal.

They also understood warfare better than anyone else, having taken on jobs patrolling the wilderness fighting monsters and enemies. Lastly, they understood when their flame of their Fire was too much, allowing them to retreat rather than fight pointless battles to the death.

Other fire users do exist, but none can contest the supremacy of the ninjas.
