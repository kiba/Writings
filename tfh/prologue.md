# Fire: A Brief History

Fire is a peculiar form of magic that's only available to man. Like all magic, it can bend and break the laws of physics to create miraculous effects. Whereas other races and species use magic freely, man struggled under its weighty requirement; strong will and determination.

Nobody knows who were the first Fire users are, but we could probably guess how they discovered it.

In the beginning, there was no cities, towns, or settlements. However, monsters and beasts stalked the land.

Mankind has no poison, claws, or much of any defensive ability. What they do have in spade is ingenuity. Man fashioned clothing, tools, and weapons from the animal he hunted. Sometime, he even harvested poison to use against the savagery of nature.

However, ingenuity wasn't always enough. Monsters are still more powerful than man. On occasion, a tribe would be wiped out or hunted to the very last person. Other time, there would be a few survivors.

It is in those moments that the display of courage and heroism would be felt. Through the sheer force of will and determination, a hero might achieve victory, or they might die in the attempt.

Those who survived their moments of heroism would obtained Fire.

It wasn't unsurprising that Fire was strongly associated with heroism for as long as we could remember.

Fire, however, was very difficult to obtain, and with so few Fire practitioners, any knowledge or kernel of insight was easily lost.

Mankind did not understand how to obtain Fire for a long time. There were all sort of rituals associated with Fire, and many tales on how to obtain Fire, but they all ultimately did nothing.

Occasionally, there would be entire dynasty found on a Fire user, with the belief that Fire would pass from one generation to the next. It must be hereditary.

It is true that Fire was hereditary, but people misunderstood that it was limited to a few people. Fire is invariant in humanity. Just as every living breathing human has a lung, so does everyone has Fire. It existed as potential in all of us, with almost no exception. It neither care about a person's pedigree or crime that one had committed, nor physical status or gender, or mental health.

One just needed a mind, and an enormous burst of willpower and determination.

Anyone could become a Fire user, but that was easier said then done.

It would take thousand of years for Fire to truly become more than mythological.

The study of Fire first truly got started in monasteries, in particular, the monks' dedication to ascetic training and martial arts. Whether it was punching water barrels all morning, constant mediation, or complete focus through on plucking small objects with eyelids and moving those around, it didn't matter their training methods. Years after years of practice eventually led them to reliably achieve Fire.

With reliability came the prospect of study, systemization, and demysterization. When the monks achieved those abilities, the monasteries became the center of learning. Many would come to study under the monks, but very few were able to endure the lifestyle.

Nonetheless, for as long as the monasteries were not molested by those who bear ill intention, their library would continue to accumulate magical knowledge generations after generations.

It wasn't until the Age of Dragons that the study of Fire took off.

No one knew why the dragons decided to become a benefactor of humanity, but it was rumored that a monk took care of a heavily injured dragon. In recognition of the monk's kindness, the dragon offered a boon.

The monk answered that humanity would live in peace and harmony.

Whatever the case may be, the dragons conquered and annexed the kingdoms in only two decades.

Over the next two centuries, humanity flourished over their rule. The dragons introduced many reforms that enriched the kingdoms. With the state's support and a large bureaucracy class, many field of study flourished. With greater agricultural productivity, population exploded.

With a cycle of virtue, the study of Fire flourished dramatically in this golden age. Religious connotation and ceremonies were stripped away until humanity discovered the core essential truth of obtaining Fire.

Fire was also no longer limited to the domain of monks or chakra warriors. Fire users tried to find applications for all their power, whether it was something as grand as civil engineering, or as mundane and domestic as cooking.

Far from extinguishing the Fire of humanity, peace instead strengthened the Fire.

It was not inevitable that civilizations would fall, but the dragons are far from omnipotent, nor perfect. Whatever the case may be, all was not well under the dragons' rule during the last few decades of their rule. Whether it was the observance of the dragons's daily feast and the long line of taxation wagons that feed their temples, or the opulence of their treasure, or their patronage of the bureucracy; envy, greed, and suspicion grew. Religious fervor against the dragons festered and flourished.

Contrary to popular beliefs, the antebellum time was a period of great prosperity. People did not suffer for the want of food, or goods they could buy. Steel was fast becoming cheap.

Whatever the case may be, wars broke out. The samurai class, which by then had thrown away their swords in favor of becoming a new set of nobility, rallied their armies and their Fire users, and went to war with the dragons and their servants.

Nobody knew how to fight wars by then, but the powers that was cultivated in peacetime was terrible. Horrific casualties quickly mounted, as the destruction of agricultural lands and civilians.

Of course, the armies learned how to fight, but that was rendered irrelevant by the collapse of supply and the destruction of productivity that the dragons and their bureaucrats cultivated.

Whatever the case may be, the years of war eventually driven out the dragons, but at a great cost. Libraries and monasteries were ransacked and destroyed. Famine and diseases spread across the land. Hordes of beasts and monsters invaded the kingdoms, destroying what's left of the samurai's armies.

With the population crash, Fire users declined in number and efficacy. Most masters who survived the war failed to find anyone to pass down their knowledge. It was also a period of anarchy, which interrupted the production of papers and other materials necessary for preserving knowledge.

The samurai nobility were despised for their greed and wanton destructions. Nobody called themselves a samurai ever again.

However, ninjas survived. They were a type of fire users who did not turn down works that were 'beneath' them, performing all kind of missions, and their members can be anyone.

Eventually, they grew to encompass the majority of Fire users, consuming any and all other classes of users.
