Still no backstory for Sun Ko, the farmer. We don't even know how old he is.

Anyway, worldbuilding on the military, repeating and clarifying some of the details:

# [u]**The Military**[/u]

At age 13, all boys, without exception, are conscripted into the militia system. They serve until the age of 50.

There are exceptions for serving, but nobody really get out of it. You'll need to be disabled or in ill health. The nobility has a higher rate of getting out of it, but they're also scrutinized more by everyone else.

Generally, serving in the militia is considered a form of taxation. Everyone is required to serve two full days without pay. Anything beyond that would require payment.

However, for a militia to be effective, there are usually a small core of full time soldiers.

In time of emergency, the militia may be called on for extended military duty, and if necessary to take to the field. Hazard pay along with regular pay is often applied.

Every militia is generally well managed enough to have rations and basic equipment, and the logistics long enough to endure for at least twenty days of fighting. The wealthier the city, the better equipped a militia usually is.

## [u]**Hell Month**[/u]

Every year, there's a special event called the Hell Month, all boys at the age of 15 are required to enter it, unless they have health problems or are disabled. Temporary health problems only give you reprieve until next year, unless you are sick again. This event takes place at major cities, and all settlements are duty bound to send their boys there.

Hell Month is the worst boot camp you'll ever experienced on Earth times one hundred. It is designed for one thing, awaken the Fire in those teenagers, and throw out the rest. It is heavily monitored by medical specialists and Med-nins, so that nobody dies. Generally, nobody gets disqualified, but they can quit at the end of each day. Even then, you're urged or prodded to keep going. By the end of Hell Month, there will generally be single digit # of survivors. By that point, the survivors had awaken their Fire.

There's a week-long religious festival preceding Hell Month to celebrate the rite of passage and adulthood of their youth. There's even rituals for the boys to help pass their trials.

After Hell Month, there's a week long festival to celebrate the new ninjas who beaten the odd. The new ninjas also become the most eligible bachelors in the kingdom.

The new apprentice ninjas then get assigned to ninja masters, who immediately start their training. They also go on missions.

If they live to the age of 25, they have a generally good chance of living out the rest of their ninja career. By then, those ninjas would become masters and be ready take on apprentices of their own.
