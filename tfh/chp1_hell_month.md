nSun Ko stood in a crowd of recruits, mostly consisting of boys like him, fifteen years old conscript. They were belted by heavy rain, but they stood still to discipline.

It was a fitting start to Hell Month, the most dreadful chapter in a man's life. Regular old boot camp stripped down a boy and trained him into a soldier, a member of the military.

This?

It wasn't about training a soldier, or bonding with your fellow conscripts, or any of the normal military purpose.

Sun Ko understood it only as a test.

An adult stepped up to the platform. He looked positively scarred, and ugly. A forehead protector adorned him, marking him as a ninja. In the distance surrounding the platform, Ko can see onlookers and observers. They were other ninjas, casting their eyes on apprentices.

"WELCOME TO HELL MONTH!" the drill instructor roared, his Fire flaring. Ko almost flinched from the intimidation. "My name is Muri Insaki, and I will be your head drill instructor." The teenager didn't know what to make of the sudden return to a calm voice. "I don't need to remind you of this, but this boot camp is not about your physical fitness. It doesn't matter how many push-ups, sit-ups, or running you can do. The only thing that matter is the awakening of your Fire. But just because I told you those things doesn't mean you actually understand those rules. I'll have to drill it in your head."

For as long he could remembered, Ko was taught that all human beings possessed Fire, which can only be freely used by ninjas to power their magic.

"GIVE ME FIFTY PUSH-UPS!" he shouted. Just like that, the crowd dropped into the ground with military precision, and started pushing.

"ONE," the body of teenagers shouted at once.

"Let begin, shall we?"

"TWO."

"If you are STRONG."

"THREE."

"Then we shall make you WEAK."

"FOUR."

"And if you are a winner?"

"FIVE."

"Then it's too EASY."

"SIX."

"We'll make it's HARD."

"SEVEN."

"If you slack off?"

"EIGHT."

"We'll push you ten times as hard."

"NINE."

By the end of the push-ups, the rules began to blend together, becoming meaningless. It seemed that the rules aren't really rules. All it does is give instructors carte blanch to make any recruits push against their limit to their breaking point.

"TO THE RACETRACK!" Insaki shouted.

More nasty-faced instructors are introduced, screaming at the slowest person running.

Ko hoped that he won't be last, but then he remembered a rule.

**If you're STRONG, we'll make you WEAK.**

Sun Ko gulped.

The class was absolutely ragged and tired, the stragglers more so. The poorest performers were all throwing up.

Insaki grinned. "It's time for the punishment phase. YOU, NUMBER FIFTY-ONE!"

"Yes, sir!" the person who managed to stay first-place.

"YOU DID SO GREAT! I want you to give me three set of fifty push-ups!"

"wha-what-what?!"

"DON'T WHAT ME! WHEN I TOLD YOU TO DO SOMETHING. YOU DO IT, OR DO I HAVE TO REPORT YOU TO YOUR COMMANDER?"

"No...."

"WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?!"

"NO, SIR."

"NOW DO IT!"

The boy was already in tear as another adult descended upon him and started shouting as number fifty-one ran.

Insaki turned back to the rest of everyone. "Now class, what rule did I just demonstrated?"

"If you are strong, then we shall make you weak," Ko uttered out loud to his horror.

Muri Insaki gave Ko a face-spitting grin. "Fifty pushup." That was his punishment. Then the instructor descended from top to down, dealing out punishment for even keeping up, not bothering to punish the last place.

This wasn't training at all. Sun Ko knew it as an abstract fact. Now he knew it in his heart as well.
