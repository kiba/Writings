# Chapter One: Hell Month

Sun Ko stood in a crowd of recruits, mostly consisting of fifteen years old boys like him. They were belted by heavy rain, but they stood still as they had been taught.

It was a fitting start to Hell Month, the most dreadful chapter in a man's life. Nobody here was new to boot camps. At the age of the thirteen, all the boys were conscripted into the military. There, they learned how to fight in formation, how to march, how to guard, how to be a soldier.

This?

It wasn't about training soldiers or learning how to fight. The purpose of this boot camp was something different altogether.

Sun Ko understood it only as a test.

An adult stepped up to the platform. He looked positively scarred, and ugly. A forehead protector adorned him, marking him as a ninja. In the distance surrounding the platform, Ko can see onlookers and observers. They were other ninjas, casting their eyes on potential apprentices. He briefly wondered why they were here. Only until near the end of Hell Month would anyone be awakening their Fire.

"WELCOME TO HELL MONTH!" the drill instructor roared, his Fire flaring. Ko almost flinched from the intimidation. "My name is Muri Insaki, and I will be your head drill instructor." The teenager didn't know what to make of the sudden return to a calm voice. "I don't need to remind you of this, but this boot camp is not about your physical fitness. It doesn't matter how many push-ups, sit-ups, or how long you can run. The only thing that matter is the awakening of your Fire, your undying spirit to endure hardship. and suffering. But just because I told you those things doesn't mean you actually understand those rules. I'll have to drill it in your head."

For as long he could remembered, Ko was taught that all human beings possessed Fire, and unless you were a vegetable, there is no exception to this rule. However, accessing and making use of Fire was another thing entirely. Only ninjas can make use of their innate capability.

"GIVE ME FIFTY PUSH-UPS!" he shouted. Just like that, the crowd dropped into the ground with military precision, and started pushing.

"ONE," the body of teenagers shouted at once.

"Let begin, shall we?"

"TWO."

"If you are STRONG."

"THREE."

"Then we shall make you WEAK."

"FOUR."

"And if you are a WINNER?"

"FIVE."

"Then it's too EASY."

"SIX."

"We'll make it HARD."

"SEVEN."

"If you slack off?"

"EIGHT."

"We'll push you TEN TIMES as hard."

"NINE."

By the end of the push-ups, the rules began to blend together, becoming meaningless. It seemed that the rules aren't really rules. All it does is give instructors carte blanch to make any recruits push against their limit to their breaking point.

"TO THE RACETRACK!" Insaki shouted.

More nasty-faced instructors are introduced, screaming at the slowest person running.

Ko hoped that he won't be last, but then he remembered a rule.

**If you're STRONG, we'll make you WEAK.**

Sun Ko gulped.

***

Ko didn't know how long they ran, but it seemed to go on forever. There were nobody timing them, nobody telling them how many laps they ran. It was all meaningless. The drill instructors only told them to keep running.

"STOP!" Insaki shouted.

It was then that the class slowed to a walk before gathering around the drill instructors. By then, the recruits were absolutely ragged. The poorest performers were all throwing up.

Insaki grinned. "It's time for the punishment phase. YOU, NUMBER FIFTY-ONE!"

"Yes, sir!" the person who managed to stay first-place said.

"YOU DID SO GREAT! I want you to give me three set of fifty push-ups!"

"wha-what-what?!"

"DON'T WHAT ME! WHEN I TOLD YOU TO DO SOMETHING. YOU DO IT, OR DO I HAVE TO REPORT YOU TO YOUR COMMANDER?"

"No...."

"WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?!"

"NO, SIR."

"NOW GIVE ME ANOTHER LAP BEFORE DOING THREE SET OF FIFTY PUSH-UPS!"

The boy was already in tear when a drill instructor descended upon him. Loud shouting prodded the winner to run another lap.

Insaki turned back to the rest of everyone. "Now class, what rule did I just demonstrated?"

"If you are strong, then we shall make you weak," Ko uttered out loud to his horror.

Muri Insaki gave Ko a face-spitting grin. "Fifty pushup for getting the answer CORRECT!" That was his punishment. Then the instructor descended from top to down, dealing out progressively less push-ups until he reached the person who finished last.

Sun Ko realized that he was given a harder punishment than anyone else.

The last-place finisher got a reprieve, but then collapsed instantly as soon as the drill instructor finished speaking.

"MEDIC!" Insaki bellowed even was a stretcher was brought out. A ninja dropped down from the height of camp's wall.

Everybody else was too busy doing their push-ups.

***

Training finished at three in the afternoon, when it was too clear that everyone's bodies were too tired to proceed. There was no point in breaking those bodies, since in about thirty days, they'll be able to reliably awaken the recruits' fire, for those who last that long.

Sun Ko didn't pay much attention to anyone as he collapsed into a warm and comfortable bed. He didn't care to think about how much better than the bedding that he got at home. He was too tired.

Going through the hygiene routine and getting dressed in warm dry cloth was practically a slog, a challenge of willpower in itself, but he completed it because Sun Ko needed a clean bed.

It was his first day, but tomorrow will repeat itself until the end of Hell Month. There were no rest for the weary.

A door creaked open. Footsteps were heard. The thunders from the rainstorm became louder. There were also voices, but he couldn't understand what they were saying.

Suddenly, there was moving warmth over his body.

Sun Ko creaked his eyes opened. He saw a radiant beauty in the form of a kunoichi. There was no mistaking it; it was the same ninja that his sisters kept talking about. Sun Ko knew it from drawing and sketches, and from stories of her adventure.

She was right there, using her medical art to heal Ko's body. At this moment, Sun Ko blushed furiously.

Ko wondered what he should say.
