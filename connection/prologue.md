Coming home after more than nine months away. Found a new child with wife named Akiko. Daughter. Born two years ago.

Station atlanta was always busy as ever, people coming in and out at all hours and all day. Not surprising that it was the nexus of the capital, Edo. Sergeant Hiroki Nishi was anxious to see his new family, which had formed without him present during his tour of duty oversea.

He stood down to this child, no, his daughter.

"Hi, you must be Akiko," he said. "Do you know who I am?"

"Mama said you're my papa," the little girl said.

He smiled. "Yes, I am."
