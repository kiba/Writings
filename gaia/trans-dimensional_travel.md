
Trans-dimensional travel is the ability to cross alternate universes, followed closely behind by the theories of trans-reality physics.

A few certain individuals, like James Archer, is capable of innately navigating the multiverse.

According to Tegmark, there are four level of all possible universes. Level one is the universe beyond our cosmological horizon, at least without FTL travel, level two are universes with different physical constraints, level three is all possible outcome of a universe existing, level four is all possible universes that can be mathematically described.

Trans-dimensional physics does not allow crossing into any branching universes created by quantum mechanics, though they allowed travel to universes that were not created by timeline branching.
