
Trans-dimensional travel is the ability to cross alternate universes, followed closely behind by the theories of trans-reality physics.

According to Tegmark, there are four level of all possible universes. Level one is the universe beyond our cosmological horizon, at least without FTL travel, level two are universes with different physical constraints, level three is all possible outcome of a universe existing, level four is all possible universes that can be mathematically described.

Very few people are capable of innate trans-dimensional navigation. One of which is James Archer.

Archer have a 'shard', those shards formed a network of universes that anyone could travel to as long as the target world have doppelganger of James Archer, defined as 'same DNA and based personality.'
