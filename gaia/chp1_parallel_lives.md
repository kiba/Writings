# Chapter One: Parallel Lives


The earliest memory that James remembered was a peculiar dream that kept repeating throughout his childhood. A black obsidan ball of some sort, dull in reflection, suddenly shattered into multiple directions into the totally black background. That was the clearest part.

What wasn't always clear was what happened after that. Over the course of many dreams, he can discern a theme. A piece of the obsidian ball, a shard, sometime big, sometime small, always landed in the vincity of a boy and a mother. The location was always different blue and brown ball, with swiveling white clouds. Maybe it was nighttime, so in that case, it was frequently black with pinprick of light, or sometime nothing at all.

Alice Archer wondered what was that all about.

Lately, her son kept drawing the same thing over and over again over the last few days. The drawings wasn't always the same, but it always depicted some sort of black ball, sometime in the process of shattering.

She wondered what did she expose her son to.

There wasn't any books or television program that she exposed to what would impress her son on this drawing.

"That's great!" she praised as her son completed yet another drawing.
