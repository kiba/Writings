# Chapter One: Parallel Lives

**Alice Archer**

It was Friday afternoon, and rush hour set in at a local farmer's market. Alice Archer found herself in bumper to bumper traffic, lining u at one of the shop register. They did not have enough people to man the line, nor register.

To the right of her, a customer was stumbling with the self-checkout mechanism, slowing down the entire line in the process by several minutes.

Her line puttered along.

She made a deep sigh. There was no use complaining. The store's not going to hire more to speed up the process. Instead she focused on what she'll have to do for this month. Rent, utility, childcare, all seemly so precarious to balance on an art teacher's salary.

Finally, it was her turn. She began putting items on the cash register table, going through the usual motion.

"What are you drawing a picture of?" Alice asked her five years old son as she looked over a picture that showed...a black ball?

Her son's face scrunched up, as if he lost in thought, before finally coming up with an answer. "I don't know?"

"You don't know?" For her part, she tilted her head.

"I don't know, mama."

The boy continued on using black colors, or variation thereof. Though the drawing looked more like a malformed sphere instead of a perfect sphere. Many markings crossed the sphere itself.

"Where did that come from? From a book you read?"

"No."

"Some other drawing?"

"No."

"Youtube?"

"No."

"Then..where did it come from?"

The boy looked up to his mother, staring into her eyes intensively. "From my sleep...I think? I remembered it from my sleep."

Alice knew perfectly well that he wasn't lying. Five years old can't get away with lies, unless the adults allowed them to.

But the black sphere ball got to come from somewhere.

**Two years later**

There was quirk in her son that started two years ago. She tried to find a reason for it in any place that she could. She searched through his browsing history and her, the games he played, all the books.

Nothing turned up as to be so specific about a black obsidian ball breaking apart into the nether.

Eventually, her psychologist convinced her that she may never resolve the true origin due to memory contamination.

So one day, Alice found herself staring at a multiple of obsidian ball drawing made over the past two years. One could see the steady evolution of her son' obsession. It gotten cleaner and more detailed over time.

It was a harmless obsession she told herself. Her son did drew other things, mainly the Doctor and his Tardis from Doctor Who, although other subject matters as well. Anything that was about traveling to other worlds absolutely interested him to the exclusion of everything else.
