# Chapter One: Parallel Lives


***
**Age Five**

"What are you drawing a picture of?" Alice asked her five years old son as she looked over a picture that showed...a black ball?

Her son tilted his head, before finally coming up with an answer. "I don't know?"

"You don't know?" For her part, she tilted her head.

"I just don't know mama."

The boy continued on using black colors, or variation thereof. Though the drawing looked more like a malformed sphere instead of a perfect sphere. Many markings crossed the sphere itself.

"Where did it come from? A picture?"

"No."

"A book?"

"No."

"Youtube?"

"No."

"Then..where did it come from?"

The boy looked up to his mother, staring into her eyes intensively. "From my sleep...I think? I remembered it from my sleep. A dream, yes. A dream!"

Alice knew perfectly well that he wasn't lying. Any form of deception would be spotted immediately.

But the black sphere ball got to come from somewhere.

**Age Seven**

There was quirk in her son that started two years ago. She tried to find a reason for it, searching his browsing history, the games he played, but nothing turned up.

Eventually, her doctor convinced her that she may never resolve the true origin of the black sphere.
