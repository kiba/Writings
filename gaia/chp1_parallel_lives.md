# Chapter One: Parallel Lives


***
**Age Five**

Alice Archer was at a huge loss.

Lately, her five years old son kept drawing the same thing over and over again over the last few days. The drawings wasn't always the same, but it always depicted some sort of black ball, sometime in the process of shattering.

She wondered what did she expose her son to.

There wasn't any books or television programs that she exposed her son to what would impress her son on this drawing. Even with the help of teachers at the daycare center, there wasn't any ideas either. So she settled for just putting up with it, as it seemed harmless.

"That's great!" she praised as her son completed yet another drawing. It was the same ball again. "Why don't you draw something else?"

"I don't wanna," her son finally answered.

"Why?" she said it with the same inquisitive tone that her son used when he asked questions about the world.

There was a very confused face. "I don't know..."

"Where do you get it from?"

"In my sleep."

"Like a dream?"

"Yeah! Dream!"

At least, that was what her son told her that day. She tried searching for more information afterward. There were just no answer, and she refused any religious or new age explanation, considering it to be a whole bunch of nonsense. It was that one itch that she couldn't answer.

At least her son seemed to be functionally normally, as far as she can tell.

**Age Seven**

She made her son kept a dream journal. The obsidian ball came and went, but there were no signs of anything happening. She wasn't the most impartial observer, however.
