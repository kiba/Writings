Unfortunately, it costs a gobble of money and expertise to make and had numerous limitations that boiled down to him being able to make only one journey in a span of twenty four hours. How he got this money? A hard drive full of cash, essentially.

He was certain that it's baloney of an idea(due to physicists rejecting it out of hand as crackpottery and his own skepticalism), but he tried it anyway.

Lo and behold. He jumped to a different dimension, but not without some preparation, such as gold jewelries and a concealed weapon.

He waltzed into town, casually sold his jewelries to whatever pawnshop nearby, and acquired clothing to blend in.

Then he meet what looked like his mom. His mother passed away years ago. Immediately, he got hugged by this woman.

It turned out that she think he's her son, and that she was really relieved to see him back.

Along the way, he seen hint of the trouble to come. People are leaving, newspapers talking about an invasion and capitulation of a country, a people being exiled or rounded up.

Confused, our intrepid traveler journeyed home to this woman's abode.

The woman wanted to know why our protagonist went away to fight in a civil war halfway around for Republican Amerika(I haven't much details on this world other than it's in an equivalent of WW2).

Drama ensues. The traveler realized that this woman is a droppleganger. How should he proceed? Do he take the place of his son? Can he convince her that he's like his son?

He couldn't answer the question about why he's fighting in a country so far away. Instead, he tried to tell the truth.

The mother did not take this as truth as it's obviously fantastical. So he tried a different tack, telling her that he isn't who she think he is. She's unconvinced, especially after doing rapid fire questioning that only her son would know.

Feeling guilty about taking somebody's place, he ran out, find a hotel room so he can think about things some more. It is this time around that he overheard a conversation about people leaving. He decided to join in, ask questions, some of which were very basic, but which were answered(in condescending ways).

It is this conversation when he realized that this person he met earlier could be in danger.

He went to bed, then woke up to the sounds of buzzing planes. People were shouting about an invasion.

Our traveler immediately realized that his mother could be in danger once again. So he made pace for his mother's abode.

Once there, he tried to convince his mother leaving, but she was in denial, reasoning that there were no way to go. Frustrated, he forcefully grabbed her hand and made way for the machine.

Along the way, she tried to protest and argued against leaving, but elected not to put up any resistance. He tried to answer her questions as best he could, but all that was making the mother thinking he's deluded.

Finally, they arrived at the machine, but she was arguing with him as to if she should enter the machine.

A plane screeched by, crashing into the ground, momentarily distracting his mother.

He lead his mother once again into the machine, and then jumped just as another plane was about to crash into the ground.
