"The fascists desired a war to determine which nation is weak and which nation is strong. They got what they wanted. Their strength ultimately proved lacking. Their armies, navies, and air force shattered and defeated. The flower of their youth all but destroyed. But we the victor, who are stronger and powerful, do not seek to build a world based on the idea that might make right. We will rebuild the nations of the vanquished and forge together a new peace where everyone can prosper." -- Empress Hoshizaki of Yipang.

"The only thing we want is war." -- Foreign minister, [enemy_nation_placeholder]

"Once again, the madness had came to claim all of us" -- Empress Hoshizaki

"Those monotheists, they are a curse upon this world. It is a commandment by their so-called God to stamp out all the other gods, by converting each member to their cause, by denying the validity of other religions. It does not matter how they will do it, through the visage of 'peace' and the 'good news' or forceful conversion. Only then, will they dominate the world." - Joshula Kelman
