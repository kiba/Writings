"The fascists desired a war to determine which nation is weak and which nation is strong. They got what they wanted. Their strength ultimately proved lacking. Their armies, navies, and air force shattered and defeated. But we the victor, who are stronger and powerful, do not seek to build a world based on the idea that might make right. We will rebuild the nations of the vanquished and forge together a new peace where everyone can prosper." -- Empress Hoshizaki of Yipang.
