"The fascists desired a war to determine which nation is weak and which nation is strong. They got what they wanted. Their strength ultimately proved lacking. Their armies, navies, and air force shattered and defeated. The flower of their youth all but destroyed. But we the victor, who are stronger and powerful, do not seek to build a world based on the idea that might make right. We will rebuild the nations of the vanquished and forge together a new peace where everyone can prosper." -- Empress Hoshizaki of Yipang.

"The only thing we want is war." -- Foreign minister, Valkiland

"Once again, the madness had came to claim all of us" -- Empress Hoshizaki

"The struggle of world domination will be fought only by us, the Valkian and the monads. Everything else is an illusion. It doesn't matter if we're fighting the Yipanagese or the Lonicans. Regardless of who we were facing, the monads all stood behind each enemy power." - Joshula Kelman

"Our military gambit worked." -- Empress Hoshizaki.

"Make no mistake, our enemies seek conquest and subjugation. Don't make the mistake of thinking that we won't be next. We ignore the continent to our peril." -- Prime Minister John von Abel
