Gaia is essentially a re-mixed version of Earth, with different nations, timeline, even geography, and yet resonate with us due to similar theme and historical progression.

It does not mean for example, that there is a UK, or Greece, or Japan, though there would be analogies. I intended to make significant use of Earth history(thus requiring historical research) to craft Gaia's own.

I do plan to set at least one well-defined story in this universe, but it will be helped if I actually do enough worldbuilding beforehand.
