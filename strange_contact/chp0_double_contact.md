A/N: Don't expect any regular updates.

This is a crossover of two fanfic, nuBSG: The Scattering, and RWBY: Emergence.

And this chapter is quick and dirty, to scratch my itch so I can write more of other things.

It was a very strange day to be flying. Videl Blaine just scrambled to her interceptor, not being told the nature of the emergency.

Only now that she was barely keeping up in her plane. Next to her was supposedly a passenger airline. It didn't look like a passenger airship nor could it fit so many people.

It was like a tiltjet without the tilt, and then enlarged several time over.

Yet this plane supposedly came from Earth. Wasn't that place supposed to be primitive?

She shrugged as she flew around in a circle, flying over a portal that made her very curious.

*Focus*, she told herself. *There's a job to do here.*

The President of the United States wasn't the least amused or excited by this whole situation, not after being dragged out of his bed and being told that there are not one, but two crisis concurrently in progress.

"Explain," he said simply to his cadre of advisors in the situation room.

"A probable portal to Remnant was located approximately one hundred miles away from Vancouver, Canada," the security advisor told him. "More threateningly, two of our carrier strike groups received extremely powerful radio transmission claiming to be aliens. The security guards can hear it on their radio.

NASA had just located the spacecraft responsible for the transmission." He showed a picture to those present. "As you can see, it is absolutely huge. Bigger than even the international space station. Moreover, they claimed to be responsible for stealing a library worth of books in Arizona, and that they accidentally picked up human children. The children will be returned completely unharmed."

"So it's not a Remnan incursion or scouting operation?" That had been on his mind when an entire library disappeared four days ago. It caused a media firestorm and an extensive investigation which turned up nothing at all, as well the aforementioned two missing teenagers who were also gone at the same time.

"If they are Remnan starships, they did not call themselves that. But interestingly, they called themselves the Colonial Refugee Fleet of the Twelves Colonies."

"As in Battlestar Galactica?"

"We don't know that. They are more likely than not, to be aliens, not humans, and certainly not from a television series."

The president nodded at that. "Let turn our attention to Remnant for a quick moment."

"We're already getting our guys ready. As soon as article five is invoked, we'll start flying in."

"Good."

Someone handed the POTUS a phone. "Yes. We're already on our way. Actually, I need to tell you something...."

"Mr. President," the national security advisor continued where they left off. "Under a threat from outer space, we should retreat to a nuclear bunker and disperse our functionalities and get our submarines in order. It is probably futile, as we do not have any capabilities to counter any orbital strike should they turn out to be hostile, but it's better than nothing."

The meeting wasn't in the least sense of being done, but the president, along with his staff and family began moving to a nearby bunker. DEFCON ONE was declared and the nation was on high alert. In response, other nations on Earth began to mobilize their military and nuclear arsenal.

William 'Bill' Adama felt old, very old. At the time of the fall, he was the oldest serving officer, and years of being on the run hadn't helped his age at all.

Finally at last, the Colonial fleet arrived at Earth.

Only there were complications.

This wasn't home of the thirteen tribe. Not at all. Gaius Baltar said it was the motherworld, not Kobol.

Of course, the bigger worries was their bombardment weapons. Not a threat to the fleet, of course, but to themselves.
