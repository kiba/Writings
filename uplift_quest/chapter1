Shouts of screams and cries for loved one from the dying and wounded verberated throughout the camp. People scurried in and out, carrying supplies, wounded and the dead alike. Yet, Ysifugywn was in his own little world. He ignored everything but the leg wound in front of him.

There were no more opium to dull the pain, so he can hear every grunt as he stitched it up.

"Hold tight," Ysifugywn warned. A louder grunt than usual resulted.

Without warning, a loud crash interrupted the usual screaming. Ysifugywn jerked his head to the right at the source. He became suddenly face to face with a very dark face and a knife at his neck.

Ysifugywn woke up at that moment. Sweat drenched his body and clothes as he tried to control his breathing.

It was a recurring dream of a memory, the Battle of Bloodvalley, but the attack on his station never happened. He traced the scars that was slashed across his chest. It seemed only yesterday when his group was ambushed.

He looked at the walls and the ceiling, full of chalk drawings of everything different from anything he ever know. It was the furthest thing from the war, the imagining and inner thought of a child, or perhaps a small door into another world.

The former carrion eater grabbed a scroll and his writing utensil from the nightstand. The child will be waking up soon, and the priest was very eager to learn everything about this world.
