# **Dramatis Personae**

* **Doctor Emily Baum** - Female biologist and de-facto mother to Silene.
* **Arthur Robinson** - Male biologist and colleague to Emily. Also a doctor.
* **Kelly Knox** - Elementary school teacher hosting the Silene-kindergartener interaction.

## Silene

The protagonist of the story. She was found on the roof of Emily Baum's neighbor. The neighbor knew that Doctor Baum is a biologist, so he took the dragon egg to the doctor. It was then promptly brought to her university lab for care and research.

The dragon hatched in the lab. In the first few hours of life was a stream of people coming in to take a look at the dragon.

She acquired her name in chapter five, taking on Silene. The name came from a story in which the princess Silene was kidnapped by a dragon.

From birth, she possessed **ancestral memories**, which helped us navigate the world and learn in the absence of a dragon parent to guide her through. She also quickly forged a strong bond with Doctor Baum.

In chapter four, she was moved to the sanctuary.

Readers named the dragon in chapter five.

In chapter eight, she dreamt of **human shapeshifting** which was an ability that her ancestral line came to possess at one time or another.

Her race is at least as intelligent as humans, as she demonstrated feats to the people around her that normally only humans are capable of. Dragons love meat and treasures. They especially valued well crafted objects.

### ABILITIES

Abilities are ranked by levels, with three being the highest.

* Level 0 - You know it.
* Level 1 - You can use it.
* Level 2 - You are proficient in it.
* Level 3 - You are a master.

***

* **Level 0: Human Shapeshifting** - the ability to transform into a human mortal. First unlocked in a memory dream. Her ancestors developed the spell for various purposes and reasons. First, for curiosity, then romantic love, and finally as a way to infiltrate human societies and make loads of money.

* **Level 3: Efficient Metabolism** - Fully grown, a whole cow should last Silene for a good few days.

* **Level 3: Ancestral Memories** You possessed knowledge passed on from one generation to the next among the matriarchal line. Those knowledge are not fully available to Silene right from the beginning, only becoming available through time and learning. They can be unlocked through three forms: experience, deliberate study, and dreams.
