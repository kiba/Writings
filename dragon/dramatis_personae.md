## Silene

The protagonist of the story, a female baby dragon conceived elsewhere in the multiverse, then hatched in a university lab in front of the biologist Emily Baum. Named in chapter five. Possessed ancestral memories, which gifted the newborn with a wide variety of knowledge, including behavioral patterns on how to act around humans.

After a few months or so, she forged a strong bond with Emily Baum as mother and daughter.

Her race is at least as intelligent as humans, as she demonstrated feats to the people around her that normally only humans are capable of.

### ABILITIES

***

* **Level 0: Human Shapeshifting** - the ability to transform into a human mortal. First unlocked in a memory dream. Her ancestors developed the spell for various purposes and reasons. First, for curiosity, then romantic love, and finally as a way to infiltrate human societies and make loads of money.

* **Level 3: Efficient Metabolism** - Fully grown, a whole cow should last Silene for a good few days.

* **Level 3: Ancestral Memories** You possessed knowledge passed on from one generation to the next among the matriarchal line. Those knowledge are not fully available to Silene right from the beginning, only becoming available through time and learning. They can be unlocked through three forms: experience, deliberate study, and dreams.
