# **chp11: Interlude: Talking Animals**

Ah, what a wonderful time to live in, Buddy thought to himself. A dragon egg had been found not too far from here, and then actually hatched into a real honest to god fantasy dragon at the local university.

Since then, there was a never dull day as Buddy scoured the web for any dragon news. Well, it's mostly human shenanigan related to the dragon, rather than the dragon itself.

Still, why did John never buy any keyboards for suitable for his paws for the last ten years? It's a pain in the bitch to navigate the web.

Hmm, maybe he could buy a paw keyboard on amazon. Wait, he needed John's credit card, and he never let Buddy purchase anything.

"Quick, turn to the live webcast at the school!" a high pitched tone said.

Buddy turned around to face Fluffy. "I was getting to that." He quickly navigated to a link using his mouse, expertly and deftly allowed flash to run.

You can never be too careful with the devil incarnate that is the flash plugin.

Immediately, the live cast started, but it's not time yet. Under a minute to go.

"We're a bit too early, aren't we?" buddy said.

"Quiet! I am trying to anticipate in excitement!"

"It's three PM and John is about to come home. I get the door."

"Yeah, whatever."

Buddy quickly jogged on his four leg to the door, his tail wagging in excitement as he panted. Once he was at the door, he sat down in anticipation.

He could watch the video, but John coming home excited him more.

A minute passed, and sure enough the door opened up to John.
