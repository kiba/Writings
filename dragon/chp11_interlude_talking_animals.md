# **chp11: Interlude: Talking Animals**

Ah, what a wonderful time to live in, Buddy thought to himself. A dragon egg had been found not too far from here, which then actually hatched into a real honest to god fantasy dragon at the local university.

Since then, there was a never dull day as Buddy scoured the web for any dragon news. Well, it's mostly human shenanigan related to the dragon, rather than the dragon itself. There's all kind of crazies coming out of the woodwork claiming to have magical power, or have knowledge of dragons, or claimed to see dragons, or any number of things really.

Still, why did John never buy any keyboards for suitable for his paws for the last ten years? It's a pain in the rear having to carefully position his paws for typing.

Hmm, maybe he could buy a paw keyboard on amazon. Wait, he needed John's credit card, and he never let Buddy purchase anything.

"Quick, turn to the live webcast at the school!" a high pitched tone said.

Buddy turned around to face Fluffy. "I was getting to that." He quickly navigated to a link using his mouse, expertly and deftly allowed flash to run.

You can never be too careful with the devil incarnate that is the flash plugin, as it can zombify even the best computer.

Immediately, the live cast started, but it's not time yet. Under a minute to go.

"We're a bit too early, aren't we?" buddy said.

"Quiet! I am trying to anticipate in excitement!"

"It's three PM and John is about to come home. I get the door."

"Yeah, whatever."

Buddy quickly jogged on his four leg to the door, his tail wagging in excitement as he panted. Once he was at the door, he sat down in anticipation.

He could watch the video, but John coming home excited him more.

A minute passed, and sure enough the door opened up to John.

"Hey Buddy!" the dog owner affectionately greeted his dog.

"Woof!" Buddy shouted as he came up close and began licking his owner.

"Whoa, there!"

Soon enough, John began petting and scratching him.

"There's a webcast going on at the local elementary school," Buddy informed him.

"What?" John stared at Buddy with confusion. "Did you just talk?"

There was a pause.

"As a matter of fact, I believed I just did," Buddy replied. Then Buddy immediately realized that before yesterday, he couldn't talk and his memories and knowledge were all fakes, somehow.

"Say that again?"

"Yes, I just talked."

John's jaw dropped. It wasn't long until the human got ahold of himself. He dialed 911.

## **John Appleseed**

"Hello, what is the nature of your emergency?" the 911 operator asked.

"I think I might be hallucinating or going insane, or that my dog just talked."

"Fluffy too," Buddy added.

"And my cat is capable of talking."

"What?"

"Listen, I just drove home and I learned that my pets are capable of human speech. Either that, or I am insane and I need to go to the hospital."

"Understood. We'll dispatch an ambulance and the police to check on you."

"Thanks."

Appleseed then opened up the door for emergency service, and followed Buddy into the living room. He spotted his cat watching a video.

"Hello Fluffy. What are you watching?" he asked.

'Meow! Be quiet! I am watching a webcast of Silene answering questions from human kittens,' Fluffy replied in annoyance.

"But you can talk."

Fluffy averted his eyes from the screen and looked up to his owner. "Cats don't talk, silly human."

"But you're doing it now!"

Fluffy cocked his head in wonder. Moments later, he shouted, "MEEEOOOOOW" in surprise.

"Fluffy, I need you to focus," the owner said. "I know you don't really follow orders, but it's for your own good. Please follow Buddy and me outside so that the emergency service or gods know what can help us."

"OK," Fluffy replied simply.

"That's it?" John questioned.

"What? Are you an idiot? Cats don't talk, until today that is, and neither can dogs, though Buddy is a bit of a stupid oaf."

"Hey!" Buddy shouted indignantly.

As soon as the Appleseed household stepped outside, they were immediately accosted by a neighboring dog.

"AAARRFF ARRRFFF. Keep away! Keep away! AARRF."

"Can somebody please shut up this mutt?" buddy said with annoyance.

"Great, now other people's dogs are talking,"  John muttered.

It wasn't before long that the police started arriving, only to be at other people's house, and concurrently, other people's pets were ferreted out into the open.

"Oh god," John said, realizing what just happened. The entire neighborhood got talking cats and dogs.

## **Mr. President**

Being the most powerful man in the world wasn't it's all cracked to be, given that the president wasn't in fact all powerful. The job disallowed debauchery traditionally afforded to dictators. The politics was so bad that it literally greyen the heads of presidents.

Therefore, the president found himself time and time again on a basketbll court.

Dribble, pass, block.

Exercise, they said, is a great way to relieve stress. Unfortunately, it wasn't nowhere near enough. It was his last year in office and his hair was already half grey.

Catch, throw, fail. His son's turn now.

"Mr. President!?" a voice shouted over the dribbling noise of the ball.

Immediately, the basketball's rhythm fell off.

"What is it?" the president said.

"We have a situation relating to Silene. This is not a joke, but there's talking dogs and cats."

"What?" the president said in spite of the warning. He turned to his son. "Sorry, you know how it is. Duty call." His son nodded.

The president walked with his security czar to the situation room.

"Explain," the president commanded.

"The site where we discovered Silene's egg is now ground zero for talking animals. It's not just people's pet who can talk now, but also crows."

"Is anybody hurt?"

"No sir, but the governor already declared a state of emergency. The national guards are being mobilized. They are awaiting your order, sir."

The president sighed as he quickly thought over the situation. "At the very least, we can begin closing off the neighborhood. Control who go in and out, or what go in and out. We don't know what this..."

"Talking animals, sir."

"Yes, whatever this talking animals protend for the future, good or bad."
