There are three ways to gain memories bestowed to you by your mother. One is through the process of formal education in the waking world forcing you to search and exercise your mind, until you stumbled upon the relevant memories. Simply experiencing the world also activate this process, though it eventually became less effective as your familiarity of the world increased. Lastly, you would sometime dream, gaining access to memories that wouldn't otherwise be drawn out by interaction or formal education when you were awake.

Tonight, you drew on this third way, drawing on the memories of your maternal ancestors' skills, knowledge, and experience across thousand of years.

Your first memory was to stand in a ritual circle, breathing hard as your body worked to expel the heat. Specifically you had just went through a lot of concentrated chanting and endurance of tremendous pain.

The contortion of your limbs to start with was less than pleasant, made worse by your inexperience, forcing you to repeat the process several times before you got it right. The bigger part of your body was even worse.

The entire process took three days to complete.

And now you stood in front of a human sized mirror.

It wasn't as ugly looking as you thought, now that you had a human perspective, but the ball of furs on your head was the most peculiar looking. Often time, you wondered why don't they all just go bald. They would look better. But then they would be less distinctive to you.

You tried to move your body to get a better view of certain parts, but you almost fell several times. How was they were able to walk on two legs, let alone move without magic?

Satisfied that the experiment was done, you decided that the transformation magic wasn't worth your time. What would you use it for? A dragon was the most imposing form in the world, and therefore the most useful.

You pitied the butt ugly mortals who had to walk on two legs for the rest of their brutally short life.

With your crystal ball and scrying, you were able to obsess yourself with a certain human. Unlike your mother and her mother's mother, you were able to look past the ugliness of the human body and find a beautiful example.

If one couldn't judge a human based on dragon-attractiveness, one should instead judge them on their mental qualities.

Courageous, strong, loyal, incorruptible.

Oh, if you can only be with him. So much so that you wished to be human, to see and think in a human way.

Then you thought of your mother's mother's research. Maybe there is a way?

**Third generation removed.**

Your mother's mother told of how she burnt down the Orc horde for chopping the head of her beloved centuries ago. So much so that it drastically changed the balance of power of mortals on several plane, a trend that still continued to this day.

However, unlike your mother's mother, you had no interest in finding a human mate. What's good was it if you couldn't produce a clutch of dragons?

Still, your grandmother's research into shapeshifting and the human form was the starting point of your merchant career.

Your ears tweaked in ancipation as you walked into a tavern. Impossible for a dragon that reached adult stage, not so for a shapeshifting dragon.

To the humans around you, you were no other race than an elf. An elf that wasn't stuck up in their 'pointy ass' as one of the local human said. To humans, elves were the most beautiful form in the world. They were still ugly to dragons, maybe even more ugly. You couldn't tell.

You automatically smiled at the tavern owner once you set your foot in, taking out some gold currencies to pay for your drink.

"Miss Goodwell?" a man said.

Immediately, you turned your head to the announcer of your cover's name.

"Yes? I am Merchant Riva Goodwell," you said.

You entered this career as a merchant, and looked what it had already reaped you! All dragons should be merchants. There's no other way to accumulate so much of a treasure horde without pissing off the mortals.

It was a good thing that your first interaction in your mortal form was with a gregarious merchant.

"Silene?"

You began to stir when somebody called for your name.

"One more minute," you said, before falling asleep.

"Silene, time to wake up, dear. I know you rest long enough."

You finally stir again at the command of your mother.

"I had a dream last night," you blurted out. "It was really clear!"

"You can tell me about it along the way," your caretaker said. "We got an appointment to keep."
