**chp7_dreaming**

There are three ways to gain memories bestowed to you by your mother. One is through the process of formal education in the waking world forcing you to search and exercise your mind, until you stumbled upon the relevant memories. Simply experiencing the world also activate this process, though at less intensity as you became more familiar with the world you found yourself in. Lastly, you would sometime dream, gaining access to memories that wouldn't otherwise be drawn out by interaction or formal education when you were awake.

Tonight, you drew on this third way, drawing on the memories of your maternal ancestors' skills and knowledge.

*****
**Seventh generation removed.**

Your first memories was the first transformation ritual performed by an ancestor 7th generation removed. It involved a lot of chanting and concentraction and concentric circles before it finally got going.

At first, one of your limb slowly contorted into an arm, an imperfect one at least. You grunted in pain and sweated as you practiced until you got it on the third try.

The whole orderal took a little over three days, only for the effect to wore off in an hour.

You frowned at all the effort being wasted and moved to another area of magic study that's more fruitfully.

*****
**Fifth generation removed.**

With your crystal ball and scrying, you were able to obsess yourself with a certain human. If one got past that he wasn't a dragon, he was most attractive, especially in his mental quality. Courageous, strong, loyal, incorruptible.

Oh, if you can only be with him. So much so that you wished to be human.

*****
**Third generation removed.**

Your grandmother told of how she burnt down the Orc horde for chopping the head of her beloved. So much so that it drastically changed the balance of power of mortals on several plane.

However, you found yourself not attracted to any human males. They were all dullard and short-lived.

Still, your grandmother's research into shapeshifting and the human form was the starting point of your merchant career.

Your ears tweaked in ancipiation as you walked into a tarven. Impossible for a dragon that reached adult stage, not so for a shapeshifting dragon.

To the humans around you, you were no other race than an elf. An elf that wasn't stuck up in their 'pointy ass' as one of the local human said.

You autoamtically smiled at the tarven owner once you set your foot in, taking out some gold currencies to pay for your drink.

"Miss Goodwell?" a man said.

Immediately, you turned your head to the announcer of your cover's name.

"Yes? I am Merchant Riva Goodwell," you said.

For a dragon, life as a merchant had reaped you so much treasure, along with the hired craftmen who constructed your grand hall. Yes, being a mortal had its perk.

"SIlene?"

You began to stir when somebody called for your name.

"One more minute," you said, before falling asleep.

"Silene, time to wake up, dear. I know you rest long enough."

You finally stir again at the command of your mother.

"I had a dream last night," you blurted out. "It was really clear!"
