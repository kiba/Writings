# **chp9 Question Time**

Not a day gone by that there wasn't anything new to experience. But this 'took the cake' as Emily put it. You seen places on television, on ipads, and in books.

You kept nagging your mother about making visits.

It was almost always a no.

Until now, that is. You were previously at the sanctuary, and now you're at a school that your mother told you about for the last week or so.

You were overwhelmed by the sheer amount of new things, and you so very much wanted to explore your surrounding. But your mother was very insistent on you following her.

In a lot of way, it the same as everywhere. Lot of geometric shapes, mostly rectangles, were of course the order of the day. But this was still new in many ways. There were all sort of smells and sounds and textures that you never felt before in your entire life at that point.

You wanted to stop and look and touch and feel. However, your mother kept moving. You don't want to be away from mommy.

So you kept following.

Then the group stopped at a door. Another human woman showed up.

"Doctor Baum, it's please to greet you in person. Of course, as you know, I am Mrs. Kelly Knox," the woman introduced herself, before looking at the dragon. "Ooooh Silene's so cute!"

"Yes, she is. And she's growing fast too. I want her to have an opportunity to meet other people, especially people of her own apparent mental age, before she grows up."

"From the progress she made, she's literally growing before your very eye. And I say that with no exaggeration."

"Exactly."

"Well, I already prepared. My students are very anxious to meet Silene."

Doctor Baum nodded before leading Silene to the back of the classroom, until Silene and her mom were in front of thirty something five years olds. Said five year olds were all seated in their desks, but also quiet. There were still lot of nervous energy waiting to be unleashed. All the way behind, Silene can see the big video equipment and the man who operated it.

You were going to be on youtube again. Suddenly, you felt shy at all the little humans in the room.

"Everyone! Meet Doctor Emily Baum and Silene!" the teacher announced.

They cheered loudly and eagerly, almost hurting the dragon's ears. It was the largest crowd of children she ever seen, and they were all very excited.

"Hello, thank you for having us. I am sure you will be a wonderful class," Doctor Baum said smoothly with a smile.

They cheered again. Some of them started shouting 'dragon'.

"Later, Silene will be playing with you. But first, Silene will be answering questions. Silene, can you introduce yourself?"

You looked at your mom with a fearful eye. She nodded in assurance.

"Mm-y mmy my," you stuttered at the beginning. "Name is Silene. And I am a dragon. I am six months old. Please to greet you." You finally let out an answer you practiced.

Then there were the squees from the audience.

"Now, she'll be answering questions. If she can't answer your question, I'll try my best to answer your questions. Mrs. Knox?"

"Right," the schoolteacher said. "Yesterday, each table has to came up with their own questions that they want Silene to answer. So we'll have all the students come up here and ask their questions. Table Apple?"

You were confused by all that explanation. Table Apple?

In any case, a group of little humans stood up, pushed in their chairs, and walked up, all looking really happy.

Finally, one of them took the microphone thingy from the teacher. Mother pointed the boy to look at the video equipment in the back.

Just like you, he stuttered as he said his name.
