# **Answer Time**

The boy asked, "do you poop?"

You tilted your head sideway at such an obvious question.

"Yes?" you answered, not quite sure of the point of asking such question. The classroom bursted into laughter at the answer.

The teacher summoned the next person to ask you a question, a girl named Sally.

Sally asked, "Can you really fly?"

"Hmmm...not yet. I will." Of course, the routine repeated again with a boy named Andrew.

"Are you magical?"

"Yep." Finally you got the hang of what was going to happen next.

"Can you breath fire?"

"I don't know yet. I think I will?"

"Cool! Awesome! Yay!" you heard some from the audience as a reaction.

"What's your favorite color?"

"All of them!"

"Do you know any other dragons?"

"No."

"Why don't you wear clothes?"

You weren't sure how to answer this one so you looked unto your caretaker, who nervously began to speak.

"Umm...Silene isn't human, so she doesn't need clothes," your mother fretted out an improvised answer. Half of the audience seemed satisfied, but the other half didn't look so convinced. Quickly, the teacher sped on to the next child.

"How big will you get?"

"Very big," you answered.

"About a five story building," your mother elaborated. "OOh! Ahhhhhh!" the audience made their impressed noise.

"Are you really only six months old? My baby sister is older and she can't even talk!"

You didn't know the answer to this question, so you once again looked on to your mother.

"Silene is just very special," your caretaker didn't really answer.

"Do you kidnap princesses?"

You tilted your head at the very last question, bulging your eyeball at the audacity of the question. There were lot of giggles.

"I like to think of Silene as a baby dragon princess, rather than a dragon that kidnap princesses," Doctor Baum said.

As quickly as the questioning begun, however, a man in a suit whispered to the teacher and your mother. Immediately, both of them were in an unhappy frown.

"Sorry, no hide and seek today," the teacher announced in her most serious voice. "There is something of an emergency and Silene need to leave now." There were a loud collective groan from the crowd.
