"....Silene...biology...seemly impossible..." you picked out from your hidey hole. There were lot of words you recognize but you didn't understand the context.

As much as you learned in months, this new civilization was obviously extraordinary complex, in ways that defy belief. Even some of the math that you were taught was obviously advanced, and you knew that because some of your ancestors had given much thought to the art of mathematics.

"But what if Silene die? She's the only one of her kind that we knew of," a male voice said.

"We need the DNA just in case," your mother answered.

"But the biology is impossible by our standard!" an agitated voice spoke up. "How do we even know if cloning will work?"

"We don't, but if Silene die, then the DNA is our last great hope."

"If only there were more dragons...." a female voice said in resignation.

The conversation continued, only with more unpronounceable words that you were unable to decipher.

You grew frustrated and bored, so you went back to your TV.

It struck you that there were no hints of energy from any of the devices built by those humans. It would seem magical that they were able to build an endless stream of forest of steels and stones.

And no explanation had ever involved the use of magic that your ancestors had studied and knew of.

"Three, four, five...."

You were also growing increasingly bored with the presented material. So bored that the television had begun to lull you to sleep...
