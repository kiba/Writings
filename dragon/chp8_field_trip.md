When Emily Baum arrived just outside at the former wildlife sanctuary, now Silene's home, there were scores of armed guards, and a permanent camp of various media outlet. Though their number had dwindled, there were still an intimidating score of journalists and cameramen waiting for anything to happen.

Of course, she had her own escort, and her own way of getting into the building unnoticed.

Her little baby dragon had shook the world when she was born, and she was still somehow holding the world's rapt attention. Aside from Silene's amazing ability to learn and the possession of knowledge within her tiny brain, she was adorable if a bit 'boring'. Nothing much happened other than the positive milestones.

She supposed the interest should had slowly fade away, and some interest fade, but mostly not. The trend in google searches, she was told, was on a downward trajectory, but it was a very slow one. As soon as something interesting happen, she was sure that the searches will shoot right back up, cementing Silene in the mind of billion of people all over the world.

That was the reason why that's the sanctuary was no longer a sanctuary for all the other animals, why armed guards from the military stood watch, why congress authorized *The Dragon Act*, all just for a little child.

And there was no way she was getting into the sanctuary's front door. No, there were other, more circumspect path, as her security agent led her to Silene's home.
