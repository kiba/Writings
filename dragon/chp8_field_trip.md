When Emily Baum arrived just outside at the former wildlife sanctuary, now Silene's home, there were scores of armed guards, and a permanent camp of various media outlet. Though their number had dwindled, there were still an intimidating score of journalists and cameramen waiting for anything to happen.

Of course, she had her own escort, and her own way of getting into the building unnoticed.

Her little baby dragon had shook the world when she was born, and she was still somehow holding the world's rapt attention. Aside from Silene's amazing ability to learn and the possession of knowledge within her tiny brain, she was adorable if a bit 'boring'. Nothing much happened other than the positive milestones.

She supposed the interest should had slowly fade away, and some interest fade, but mostly not. The trend in google searches, she was told, was on a downward trajectory, but it was a very slow one. As soon as something interesting happen, she was sure that the searches will shoot right back up, cementing Silene in the mind of billion of people all over the world.

That was the reason why that's the sanctuary was no longer a sanctuary for all the other animals, why armed guards from the military stood watch, why congress authorized *The Dragon Act*, all just for a little child.

And there was no way she was getting into the sanctuary's front door. No, there were other, more circumspect path, as her security agent led her to Silene's nesting place.

There she was, the baby dragon still sleeping soundly in the same place that Baum left her last night.

The biologist shook her charge gently, before calling her name.

"One more minute," the dragon reflexively replied.

Doctor Baum decided to indulge the dragon's request, before finally waking the dragon up a few minutes later. From there, she told the dragon that they would be going to an elementary school.

Breakfast was the same usual affair, a group meal with the facility staff. A random assortment of military personnel and guards joined in, as were the scientists, some biologists, though more physicists to deal with the unfamiliar 'freaky' possibly magical biology and scientists in other specialities.

She sat next to the dragon child, who content herself with chewing several pieces of steak at the same time, not paying particularly to the conversation. Starches and veggies were usually finished first, and Silene sought to save the best for last, along with copious amount of tabasco sauce.

"So, Greywater Elementary?" Doctor Arthur Robinson asked.

"We'll be making a visit there. It's time for her to interact with people her own age," Baum answered.

"Huh. Somehow, I doubt she will stay that way for long. The baby's only about six months old, and she's more like five in human term."

"Of course, but I want Silene to have a good life. I don't know what dragons want, but the publicity will ensure she will remain protected."

"She sounds like your child more and more each passing day. Have you thought of adopting her?"

"I don't know," Doctor Baum said. "It's a human thing. Is it right to apply human conventions to a different species altogether?"
"That's what we'll have to find out, I guess."

When it was time to go, she led Silene, walking the child to the designated black SUV, and it was part of a convoy. One other SUV had arrived before as decoy inside the parking lot that was erected in record time.

It went to show how seriously the state took the dragon business.

Silene wasn't accorded anything like a nobility title, or was treated like the head of the state. Yet, she was treated as a VIP or possibly a quote 'strategic person' unquote by the President.

Doctor Baum watched the baby dragon stare out in the tinted window, as crowds of people lined up to watch the convoy went by.

She supposed that the PR department of the Dragon Project did too good of a job, tweeting each and every development.

It wasn't only positive attention that the project got from the public at large. The fame had directly impacted her life to the point that she wasn't able to live at her home address anymore. The media was very through in digging through records. If the media didn't invade her privacy, nefarious hackers would, through social engineering and good old fashioned malware installs.

People were insatiable curious about a magical creature coming alive.

The convoy finally stopped at the elementary school. Armed no-nonsense guard stood outside, K-9 dogs patrol the the parameters. Crowd of protestors, the media, and animal right activists stood outside the street.

The door slid opened, and she beckoned Silene to follow her.

As soon as Silene was outside, she gaze curiously at everything around her. Excluding the transit to Silene's new home, it was the first time that the dragon been anywhere.

"Come on," Doctor Baum said. "It's time to meet people around your age."

"OOOKKK," Silene answered reluctantly, still wanting to explore the environment some more.

There were a lot of work in arranging this visit, and most school didn't want to host for fear of offending the safety conscious parents, even with enthusiastic support for meeting Silene. This school got very lucky. Not only there were lot of supporters, the principal worked out a policy allowing some kids to stay home, and treating this whole event as a field trip, spinning it as an educational opportunity.

 The doctor thought it was important, sure, but she wasn't exactly clear on how it was educational. Best not to question why.

As such, it was selected as the first school to host this event. Undoubtedly, if it all went well, there will be more events to come.

As Doctor Baum, Silene, and a crowd of scientists and bureaucrat entered the door, they became flanked with plain suited federal agents.

There were lot of paranoia, especially after some animal right militant firebombed a colleague's house some months ago. That's not including threats that she had gotten from some people.

Finally, they arrived at a particular classroom, selected at random. There would be school-wide event later, but a class was better for personal interaction.
