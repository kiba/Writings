When Emily Baum arrived just outside at the former wildlife sanctuary, now Silene's home, there were scores of armed guards, and a permanent camp of various media outlet. Though their number had dwindled, there were still an intimidating score of journalists and cameramen waiting for anything to happen.

Of course, she had her own escort, and her own way of getting into the building unnoticed.

Her little baby dragon had shook the world when she was born, and she was still somehow holding the world's rapt attention. Aside from Silene's amazing ability to learn and the possession of knowledge within her tiny brain, she was adorable if a bit 'boring'. Nothing much happened other than the positive milestones.

She supposed the interest should had slowly fade away, and some interest fade, but mostly not. The trend in google searches, she was told, was on a downward trajectory, but it was a very slow one. As soon as something interesting happen, she was sure that the searches will shoot right back up, cementing Silene in the mind of billion of people all over the world.

That was the reason why that's the sanctuary was no longer a sanctuary for all the other animals, why armed guards from the military stood watch, why congress authorized *The Dragon Act*, all just for a little child.

And there was no way she was getting into the sanctuary's front door. No, there were other, more circumspect path, as her security agent led her to Silene's nesting place.

There she was, the baby dragon still sleeping soundly in the same place that Baum left her last night.

The biologist shook her charge gently, before calling her name.

"One more minute," the dragon reflexively replied.

Doctor Baum decided to indulge the dragon request, before finally waking the dragon up. From there, she told the dragon that they would be going to an elementary school.

Breakfast was the same usual affair, a group meal with the facility staff. A random assortment of military personnel and guards joined in, as were the scientists, some biologists, though more physicists to deal with the unfamiliar 'freaky' possiblily magical biology and scientists in other specialities.

She sat next to the dragon child, who content herself with chewing several pieces of steak at the same time, not paying particularly to the conversation. Starches and veggies were usually finished first, and Silene sought to save the best for last, along with copious amount of tasbaco sauce.

"So, Greywater Elementary?" Doctor Arthur Roe asked.

"We'll be making a visit there. It's time for her to interact with people her own age," Baum answered.

"Huh. Somehow, I doubt she will stay that way for long. The baby's only about six months old, and she's more like five in human term."

"Of course, but I want Silene to have a good life. I don't know what dragons want, but the publicity will ensure she will remain protected."

"She sounds like your child. Have you thought of adopting him?"

"I don't know," Doctor Baum said. "It's a human thing.                                                                                                                                                              "
