[B]The Sanctuary[/B]

You later learned that your new home was what the humans called, a sanctuary, a place where animals can be cared for in peace.

When the men let you out of nest, and took it away, you had entered this place, an enclosed space that was obviously artificially landscaped. It was mostly grass with a large tree in the middle.

And steeeeaaaaak!

There was a piece of bovine meat, freshly cut near the center of your new home.

You raced forward with your limbs, with your caretaker coming close behind. Like yesterday, you chewed up the steak and swallowed it whole.

Your human mother bent down to pet you on your skin.

"This will be your new home," she said. "Ah, I forgot. What should I name you?"

You didn't understand a single thing she said, aside from her obvious affection. You simply purred deeply at the stroking motion.

[B]A Month Later[/B]

It had became a routine living in this space.

You woke up, have breakfast, learn English and some other stuff, play with mother, and then met people you don't know.

Sometime, the humans just leave you alone, like now. You simply blasked in the sun, soaking up the heat.

Slowly, as you began to increase your fluency of English and drawn on your ancesterial memories, you began to realize that this was very different world, full of amazing and unbelivable things.

In particular, you noticed early on that metals and steels were extremely common, almost as if wasn't any of particular special note. This civilization was extraordinary rich.

You heard excited chatter coming from your mother and her coworkers.

It was a frequent event in your short life. Mother and the others was always interested in how dragons lived.

This had puzzled you greatly. No humans had ever shown so much interest in the lives of dragon, even if you couldn't answer most questions.

They were still learning your immature draconic tongue, and you were still learning English. In particular, it was difficult to learn their. They had so many words for so many concepts.

Meanwhile, your meal as of late had gotten larger, simply because it looked bigger and tasted jucier.

[B]April 3rd, 2015[/B]

Not too long ago, you thought that people were actually getting killed on television. Your mother corrected that misconception pretty early on, and you went on a tangent asking everything about how television works until your mother can't answer.

There was a lot that she didn't know.

But the television programs you had been watching of late was mostly the educational sort.

You were learning about how to add and subtract and arithmetic from Sesame Street, as well learning it from live human teachers.

Once again, there were excited chatters from the humans again. They're always up to something when it did.

Curious, you used the remote(which you learned was NOT food) to turn off the television and began walking.

Mathematics was...

[X] No dragon ever needed to do that.
[X] Your mother and her mother, and her mother's mother only learned what was necessary to pay for treasure and craftmen.
[X] You had a sense that mathematics was something that Dragons can sometime specialize in, even going so far as to discover new theorems and proofs.

Your mother/caretaker named you...

[X] Write-in. Why?

Why are they so excited?

[X] Dignitary visit. Who, and why?
[X] [I]Sigh[/I], yet another crowd of gawkers wanting to take pictures.
[X] Write-in.
