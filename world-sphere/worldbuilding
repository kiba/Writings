[B]Universe ID: ImMPvsRRW1SrYsZJktBc[/B]

In our survey of this universe, we discovered what appeared at first to be a dyson sphere, designated as Alpha-Delta-Zero-Niner-Gamma.

However numerous expeditions to this sphere had made it clear that it was no longer powered by its stars, and the stellar material was already mined and transformed into construction material for the construct. The star was no longer sufficient enough to power the growing demand of the sphere. Once a new and exotic energy source had been discovered, the star was rendered obsolete and promptly disassembled for matters.

We believe that this sphere no longer warranted the classification of a dyson sphere, and should be instead be classified as a transphere or perhaps exosphere. One of those two term should be fine, though better naming alternate may come up.

We must note that this sphere had properties that no other construct had, or have the right to be. We believed that the very law of physics was manipulated in this sphere to attain such size and capabilities.

[B]Mass, Composition, Size[/B]

The mass of the sphere is impossible to estimate accurately due to reality manipulation of the underlying physical law of the universe. Nonetheless, we were able to estimate a lower bound of the sphere, assuming that the object is made of only ordinary sphere. The result would be a collapse of the sphere into a supermassive blackhole. Exactly how large is unknown.

We noted that the sphere continues to expand at a constant rate of about a jupiter volume per year. Exactly why it grew at an decidedly slow rate, given their matter creation technologies and the virtually unlimited source of energy that they possessed.

The composition of the sphere's mass was mostly only ordinary matters commonly found in the universe, such as iron, copper, hydrogen, and so on. However, some part of the construct were made of extremely superheavy elements, located in another island of stability on the periodic table beyond what we had already discovered. Finally, some part of the structure simply defied analysis as we were unable to analyze its atomic structure. Our technologies were able to procure a sample to bring back home for our researchers, despite every attempt to do so.

[B]Objects, Infrastructure, Places, Machines, etc[/B]

There are places within the sphere that allowed the travel and presence of human beings without the necessary spacesuit and environmental protection suit. Remarkably, this extended to cover all the sphere.

Below are part of the sphere infrastructure we encountered.

[B]Infrastructure[/B]

* [B]Translight Rail Service[/B] - It was not possible to traverse the entirety of the sphere on foot in a speedy manner, not unless one wants to expend eons to do so. Nor would other form of transportations, such as train, cars, airplanes, or even rocketry, be sufficient. The best way to travel was to use the Translight Rail Service, or TRS, which allowed extremely safe travel at the speed of light.

* [B]Cubes[/B] - Reality manipulation structures made into a perfect cube.

[B]Machines of the Sphere[/B]

* [B]Builders[/B] - A class of machines that came in all shape and sides, mostly sporting multiple of appendages and tools to perform their duty in the sphere. They are responsible for maintenance and construction of materials. We assumed that there is a factory somewhere, but it is possible that with the level of technologies possessed by the sphere, this is simply unnecessary.

* [B]Guards[/B] - Autonomous security agents that protect sensitive areas of the Sphere and act as a security force against threats to the sphere should it encounter any. Luckily for us, we were not such enemies or pose much of a threat.

* [B]Assistant[/B] - An AI or VI that answered questions and assisted with our travel in the sphere. They were forbidden from answering certain query, such as the most basic question...what is the purpose of this sphere, and who built and controlled it?

[B]World One-Zero-Three-Seven-Four of Sphere Alpha-Delta-Zero-Niner-Gamma[/B]

One of the function of the construct was apparently to nourish a growing list of living worlds where life, artificial or otherwise, can flourish.

Luck had it that we encountered a world where the local branch of humanity lived. We destinate this world-sphere One-Zero-Three-Seven-Four, a world that was about twice the size of a jupiter volume planet.

The 'surface' level would resemble our planet Earth in both appearance and geography. Otherwise however, it is limited by a ceiling at a thousand hundred kilometer away from the surface, which was for all purpose and intent impenetrable to the inhabitants and to us. We were able to access with only permission with the Entity that managed this particular world.

Since there are no star available to power the lifeform on this sphere, alternatives had to be provided. The ceiling, for example, provide sunlights through illumination from the ceiling, allowing the process of photosynthesis. The uneven lighting effect was responsible for much of the surface weather condition on this planet. However, it was not the only energy source.

Unlike our Earth, sphere One-Zero-Three-Seven-Four was more a matryoshka of hallow surfaces wrapped around each other as one delved deeper into the core.

The "surface" provided sunlight over an expansive sky. This cannot be said for the underground layers.

Special cubes and megastructure embedded into the sphere provided layer of hollowness, energy, and effect fields that granted general habitability.

For example, on the bottom of some part of the 'surface' ocean, there are cube megastructure that lower the pressure in the surrounding water, allowing submarines to dive deeply than otherwise would be possible.

Humanity, on the other hand, only occupied a very small portion volume of the surface, much less the inner layers of the sphere and the deep ocean, although its speed had grown rapidly since industrialization in their history.
