[b]*Sigh* This world is just like home, for the last thirty three? I lost count.[/b]

[i]Good grief. What's wrong with visiting a world that's just almost like home?[/i]

[b]But it's BORING! Nothing interesting happens. Just the same usual shit.[/b]

[i]Oh god. I know exactly what you're thinking right now.[/i]

[b]Exactly! I am going to spice it up by adding a fantastical element, like a character from Naruto. See what happens next.[/b]

[i]Pray tell, what character?[/i]

[b]Maito Gai of course![/b]

[i]Whaaaaa? Oh god, at least it's not one of the villains.[/i]

[b]Why would I want to do that? The Rabbit Goddess and other beings are wishing uninteresting things to happen.[/b]

[i]I approve of your change...for now, but if it has a negative impact, I am pushing for retroactive casuality change. And you will be in my personal prison for the next thousand years.[/i]

[b]I swear on my life![/b]

You are now Maito Gai in the real world, with his youthfulness and the GENIUS OF HARD WORK as well as your Earthborn knowledge and experience.


Select a point in the timeline.

[X] Third Shinobi World War - A crucible which forges you into the ninja you became and the reason why you're insane.
[X] Gai-sensei. Post-war. You are now a Jonin of the Village Hidden in the Leaf and train three pupils of your own.
[X] Fourth Shinobi World War - You are the peak of your ability and experience, putting everything you learned to the test.

Where you are:

[X] At home. You are a regular computer programmer with a regular middle class lifestyle.
[X] Stranded. You have no identity and nothing to proves that you are. It's a good thing you are on a deserted topical island.
[X] At a movie set. You are trying to make it big as the next Bruce Lee. But your terrible sense of fashion and sudden shout of YOUTHFULLNESS had not endeared you to hollywood.
