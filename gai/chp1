0.1 Introduction

It was a breezy cool morning on this particular topical island. Wave crashed into a picturesque beach. Flock of geese squawked overhead on a nearby hill. Crabs tattered on the beach looking for its next meal. In the bay was nice and transparent water, completely undrinkable to humans.

Further in-land was a jungle full of life. There's even a waterfall and a small stream that led all the way up to a snowcapped mountain.

It was the very picture of paradise on Earth.

Except, it's a deserted island. And without the survival skills and hard work required, one will die on this topical island. No, it wasn't close to paradise at all. Just another slice of untamed wilderness on this Earth.

And you, Might Guy, had just washed ashore, in nothing but your boxer. Knocked out, but alive.

Water continued to washed over you as you flickered your eyes open.

You groaned.

"Where am I?" you said. Your body finally stood on its two legs.

Oh right. Last night was a rather nasty storm. The cruise ship you were on capsided. Despite the training beforehand, people panicked, and almost nobody got on the lifeboats.

You were pretty sure that you were one of the few remaining survivors. Most likely, they either went down with the ship or simply drowned in the storm.

You counted your lucky stars that you survived this far.

Compulsively, you did a few kicks and punches.

"Thanks Kami I survived! WOOT! I will pay back a hundred time by getting myself rescued!" you declared.

Immediately, you scanned the surrounding for threats as a matter of habit and found nothing.

You pondered your next course of action.
