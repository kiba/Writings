After the experimentation with unknown cornstalks, all he could think was, "ah".

"Shit! Shit! Shit!" A thought occurred to him.

Like a man possessed, the programmer yanked his chair out of the bedroom. Everything else followed. Objects were dumbed into the living room, transforming it from an unlived space to a pile of junk. The only thing left inside was his desktop computer and a webcam, which was left to monitor the portal.

Next, he implemented several security measures. He blocked the window with bookcases. The entry to the bedroom was to be blocked with another bookcase unless he or someone else was in the former bedroom.

"There, that should do it for now," he said. "Next, I need to get a lock. And of course lab rats and sealants...and..."

He muttered the rest of the items as he sat down on a couch, grabbing his macbook pro. He surfed to Amazon.ca and promptly began an uncharacteristic [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tPUoeipce0Bkzw-tk9An3mmEVWUXqrE-DlAJjvaHelc/edit?usp=sharing]massive shopping spree[/url].

Predictably, his phone rang afterward.

"Hello, this is-"

"I know what you're calling for. It's all legitimate purchases by me. Nobody took my credit card," he uttered the words as quickly as he could. "Sorry. But I need to buy something really fast."

"We still need to verify you."

He sighed as he sat through customer service.

There are things you couldn't buy on Amazon, such as the UV conversion kit for a camera, which almost cost as much as the camera itself. Amazon certainly didn't sell pets. What he failed to realize is that the cages and food should be bought on the same day as you buy the pet, otherwise you wouldn't have food to feed your lab subjects.

He grumbled as the cashier scanned extra cages along with the birds and the mice.

The problem of buying online is that you have to wait a few business days for goods to arrive. In hindsight, he should hadn't done that. He could have bought everything from the local big box retailer. In the meantime, he returned to his former bedroom with experimental objects for testing.

There was a tiny edge that he could perceive, and he wanted to know if it was sharp.

"Test object number one, a worthless book," he vocalized, before carefully wracking said object against the outside edge of the portal. "Huh. It looks like there's no cut." He tried wracking the book on the inside as well. It still didn't do anything.

"There's an apparent mass?" the engineer pondered.

He tried various objects, everything from papers to steel rods, and yet there was no cut.

"Hmm. What if I tried to pull on it?"

He grabbed fabrics from one of his window and fashioned a rope around the portal. With a tentative pull, it didn't move.

He strained harder. It still didn't move.

Then harder still, until it finally broke, sending him stumbling backward until he collapsed into the floor.

"That was extremely unsatisfying," the programmer said. "Maybe I should get a better rope? Or maybe I am doing it wrong? Maybe you're supposed to will it to move? Why did a portal appeared here somewhere else, rather than some other place? Maybe this place is special. Or maybe I am special?"

[i]Move[/i], he thought. The portal shimmered.
