Goal: Send a baby through a portal to a different universe one-way using a machine. The baby will not be rescued and there will be no further crossover.
There can be further crossover once the story take place.
That may be twenty-three twenty-five years after the initial travel event.

*Why did the baby get sent through the portal?* Parental desperation.

*What is the cause of parental desperation?* The parents are in a completely hopeless situation in which it seemed that the survival of anyone is in serious doubt.

*Describe the completely hopeless situation*. They are in an airship which is about to crash with everyone on board. In particular, they will crash into a jungle that is particularly known for killing nearly everyone.

*What about parachutes?*

Parachutes are useless for anybody not trained to use them.
