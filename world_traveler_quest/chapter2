A sealing accident had sent her to this place, likely a different dimension. However, Yumi didn't know how to get back. There wasn't even a sun in the sky, yet it does have a night and day cycle, which was completely useless to her. The place seemed to stretch forever with unidentificable metal and glass objects in writings she couldn't understand.

The clones found nothing in the dwelling. Unlike everything else, it was made of wood, and it seemed to be a residence of some kind. It seemed to a house belonging to nobility, but at the same it's not. For one, it was too small.

Antagonizing a probable battle wizard would likely to result in an unpleasant death. Seriously, she had all the characteristic look of a Naruto ninja, even a Leaf headband. One would be a fool to attack this woman, expecting victory. No, 'fortune favors the bold' ain't going to work here, not when I could recruit a battle wizard instead.

"You're eating my food," I blurted out. I meant something else!

The probable wizard didn't respond at first. Instead, she continued chewing for a few seconds, before giving a loud burp. Then the blank face transformed into a rather serious one.

"So, you are the owner of this house," she said. "So that were the drawings are?" I didn't know what she was talking about until I realized that she was talking about my photographs. Does that mean she didn't have camera in her universe.

"Yes, this is my house, and you're eating my food," I asserted more forcefully. At this point, I was sweating profusely, shaking even. The woman didn't look slightly afraid. As a matter of fact, she took a small step. I managed to stay my ground.

"I am very sorry," she said, before bowing to me. "But forgive me, I couldn't find any food source anywhere. I didn't even find a single living thing in this world, not a single plant nor animal, or even a human being." She smiled thinly. "Until now."

It took me a few moment before I could formulate a response.

"If there's none in this place, then I wouldn't know where to find any more food. You ate the last of it."

Her face fell.

"But I do know where to find more of it," I said. "Tell me, are you familiar with different dimensions?"

"Of course, I do. That's what I am in right now, right?" she responded as if I am stating an obvious fact.

"How do you know this?"

"Um. We always know there are dimensions, like the Pureland and the Summon Realm."

"Right. I can take to a place that I know, but I cannot take you home."

"What? How? Why?"

"Do you know of the concept of parallel universes?"

"No."

"Let me put it this way. This is an infinite copies of you, me, and everyone, including your world and its subdimensions."

"I don't understand."

"Basically, it will take me a while to find your world, as I have only the ability to travel to world similiar to the world I am in. I don't know about this dimension, it seemed unique. It shouldn't be here. Anyway, even if I do find the world that is like your home, I cannot distinguish between the infinite worlds to find your true home."

She blinked several time trying to digest just what I told her.

"You're telling me that it will be hard, right."

"Not hard. Virtually impossible."

"Impossible....no."

"I am sorry."

"No.....no."

Fortunately for me, she was a reasonable person, unlike the survivors on zombie worlds, who are unreasonable assholes who can't see a zombie until it is right in her face. On the other hand, explaining the idea of the multiverse was a huge challenge, and I had to resist the urge to sigh.

However, she did make it clear that if I don't travel soon, she will make me wish that I was never born.

Since she was so unused to the environment that she was in, she started asking all sort of question.

"What is this?" she asked.

"A television screen. It let us view moving pictures."

"Really? There are people in it."

"They are recordings, sort like writing, that captured a moment."

"Really? Are there seals in this thing?"

"There's no magic in it, ninja or otherwise, if that's what you're asking."

"They're not magic. They're made of chakra."

I rolled my eyes at her. "Whatever, they're magic to me."
