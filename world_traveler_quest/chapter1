It isn't everyday that you get to travel to different realities.

[i]"Authorities are investigating the cause of the power outage, allegedly caused by a house that flickered in and out of existence." -- Random World #2[/i]

Of course, because I chose to travel in a house instead of a car, there will be at least one news cycle about me in those realities.

[i]"Mystery House, Hoax or Fact?" -- Random World #3[/i]

One of those legacy I'll leave behind on every jump is endless speculation and conspiracy theories.

[i]"The Quuxclear Energy Agency is assisting the FBI in their investigation, especially concerning the possibility of Quuxclear radiation." -- Random World #4[/i]

But the reason I travel isn't because I want to befuddle the locals, although that's fun. Really, I have a sense of wanderlust, to see places and people different from my own, like that one world where instead of vanilla ice cream, they have beef ice cream.

It wasn't sufficiently interesting to investigate; the world was too similar to my own.

Though, I did apparently stumbled upon TVLand realities.

[i]"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the President of the United States, Donald Trump!"[/i]

I really need to figure out a way to cloak my house, because I can't explore at best for a few hours before getting swamped by the locals wanting to know why a house appeared out of thin air.

And that was before I got myself into serious trouble landing in Zombieland.
